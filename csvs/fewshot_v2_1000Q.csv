0,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The resident should ensure that all complications, even minor ones, are accurately documented in the operative report and disclosed to the patient. Failing to report the complication could lead to inadequate patient care and potential legal issues. Reporting the physician to the ethics committee or refusing to dictate the report are extreme actions not warranted by this situation. The attending's advice to withhold the information is unethical and against standard medical practice.

Answer: A",2399
1,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: Cisplatin, the chemotherapy agent used, commonly causes hearing problems including severe hearing loss. Given the patient's recent chemotherapy and the sensorineural hearing loss, the most likely cause is cisplatin. Among the options, only the generation of free radicals (Option C) is a known mechanism of cisplatin's action, contributing to its cytotoxic effects and side effects like hearing loss.

Answer: C",1961
2,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with decreased urinary output, mottled purplish discoloration of the feet, and laboratory findings consistent with vasculitis (elevated eosinophils and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, which are characteristic of cholesterol embolization. However, given the history of asthma and the presence of eosinophilia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is more likely. Polyarteritis nodosa would not typically present with such prominent respiratory involvement or eosinophilia.

Answer: C",2052
3,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sepsis-like symptoms including fever, hypotension, and left lower quadrant pain. The blood oozing from the IV site suggests possible septic thrombophlebitis. The laboratory findings include a low platelet count, elevated D-dimer, and a specific reaction to phenol indicating a complex polysaccharide structure, which is characteristic of gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria such as *Escherichia coli* can produce such structures. The blood culture is most likely to show lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar.

Answer: D",2208
4,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes and sneezing suggest allergic conjunctivitis, given his history of similar episodes in spring and his allergy-like symptoms. The visual acuity and examination findings do not indicate an infection or inflammation requiring antibiotics or corticosteroids. Erythromycin is used for bacterial infections, which is unlikely here. Warm compresses are used for conditions like blepharitis, not allergic conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone is a potent corticosteroid that could be overkill for mild allergic conjunctivitis. Ketotifen eye drops are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers commonly used for allergic conjunctivitis.

Answer: B",1872
5,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the epigastric area, diaphoresis, and marked distress, which are classic signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given his history of hypertension and recent cocaine abuse, there is a high suspicion for unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Diltiazem and propranolol are both used to manage ACS, but they have specific considerations. Labetalol is a non-selective alpha and beta blocker, which could be considered. However, the first step should be to provide reassurance and continuous monitoring to stabilize the patient and monitor for any changes in condition, as definitive treatment should be guided by further diagnostic testing such as cardiac enzymes and possibly an ECG.

Answer: D",2297
6,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has right flank pain, hypertension, and dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. These findings suggest a blockage in the urinary tract. Benign prostatic hyperplasia typically causes symptoms related to urinary obstruction but would not commonly cause dilation of the ureter. Common iliac artery aneurysm and urethral stricture are less likely given the absence of lower urinary tract symptoms and the presence of hypertension. Renal artery stenosis can cause renovascular hypertension and lead to renal dysfunction, resulting in ureteral dilation due to decreased blood flow to the kidney. Therefore, renal artery stenosis is the most likely underlying cause.

Answer: A",1512
7,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with acute chest pain, ST-segment depressions, and elevated troponin, indicating acute coronary syndrome. He has hypertension and is undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, suggesting a need for antiplatelet therapy to prevent further thrombotic events. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker and would not be indicated for acute coronary syndrome. Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant, but the patient already received percutaneous coronary intervention, making anticoagulation less critical. Spironolactone is a diuretic and would not address the need for antiplatelet therapy. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that reduces the risk of thrombotic events, making it the appropriate addition to the patient's regimen.

Answer: C",1978
8,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is requesting a change from OCPs to an IUD. The options provided relate to conditions that would make IUD placement contraindicated. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism does not contraindicate IUD placement. Breast cancer and liver neoplasms do not inherently contraindicate IUD use. However, active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can increase the risk of complications such as infection and adhesions, making IUD placement contraindicated.

Answer: B",2060
9,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's complaint and the described nail appearance are consistent with onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nail. The other options (silvery plaques, flesh-colored papules, erosions of dental enamel, and a heart murmur) do not align with the typical presentation of onychomycosis. 

Answer: None of the given options (A, B, C, or D) are directly related to onychomycosis. However, if forced to choose based on the context provided, none fit better than the others, so we select the closest match, which is:

Answer: A",1060
10,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The confirmatory test for HIV involves detecting specific antibodies or viral components. Zidovudine administration suggests a confirmed HIV infection, and the confirmatory test would be an antibody test to identify the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. The options mentioning DNA-binding proteins, RNA, and DNA do not align with the typical confirmatory tests for HIV. The HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is used to confirm HIV infection by detecting specific antibodies.

Answer: D",1915
11,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with significant weight loss, anemia, splenomegaly, and extensive bone marrow fibrosis, along with a positive JAK2 assay. These findings are consistent with primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Ruxolitinib is specifically indicated for the treatment of PMF and can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. Prednisone is used for immune suppression but is not indicated for PMF. Cladribine is used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, and imatinib is used for chronic myeloid leukemia. Therefore, ruxolitinib is the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: D",2301
12,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral hearing loss and gait unsteadiness, along with intermittent tingling sensations. These symptoms are consistent with a cerebellar or brainstem lesion. The genetic mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 encoding merlin is characteristic of Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), which is associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas) and other tumors like meningiomas. Renal cell carcinoma and vascular malformations are not typically associated with NF2. Astrocytomas are more commonly associated with gliomas rather than NF2.

Answer: B",1575
13,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a mid-systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is characteristic of a tricuspid regurgitation murmur. Standing from a supine position would increase right atrial pressure due to the redistribution of blood volume. This does not affect pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pacemaker function, or diastolic filling time.

Answer: A",1507
14,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The process described involves co-infection of a host cell by two viruses from the same family, leading to the packaging of genome segments from both viruses into a new, stable, and viable virus particle. This phenomenon is characteristic of genetic reassortment, where genome segments are exchanged between different viral strains. Among the given options, only influenza viruses (like the Spanish flu) are known to undergo genetic reassortment. Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, and rotavirus do not typically undergo this process. Therefore, the virus capable of this process is not among the given options.

Answer: A",1534
15,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include severe abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms are more consistent with acute cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis, especially given the history of recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. However, the calcified mass near the gallbladder raises suspicion for gallbladder cancer, which can present similarly. Given the family history of abdominal cancer, gallbladder cancer should be excluded first. Pancreatitis typically presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back, more frequent nausea, and less commonly a mass near the gallbladder. 

Answer: B",1991
16,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when there are blooming flowers, indicating an allergic reaction to pollen. This suggests an allergic asthma triggered by environmental allergens. IL-13 is known to promote allergic responses and favor the class switching of IgE antibodies, which are involved in allergic reactions. IL-2, IL-10, and IL-4 do not specifically align with the described mechanism of reducing the exaggerated allergic response to allergens. Therefore, the experimental therapy targeting the mediator favoring class switching of antibodies is most likely targeting IL-13.

Answer: C",1995
17,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The study aims to compare two groups of infants (those with and without BRUE) while controlling for confounding variables such as age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. By matching the two groups for these factors, the study ensures that any differences observed can be more confidently attributed to the outcome of interest rather than these confounders. This method of ensuring comparability between groups is known as matching.

Answer: D",1906
18,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of sharp, severe, constant chest pain that worsens on lying down and improves with leaning forward, along with radiation to the shoulders and neck, suggest acute pericarditis. The presence of a scratching sound at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward is consistent with a pericardial friction rub. The ECG may show nonspecific changes but does not indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. Indomethacin and ibuprofen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can help reduce inflammation and pain associated with pericarditis. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that can prevent NSAID-induced gastric mucosal injury. Colchicine is an effective treatment for recurrent pericarditis. Pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy are invasive procedures typically reserved for cases with large effusions or tamponade, which are not indicated here given the absence of such findings.

Answer: B",1572
19,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, somnolence, ataxia, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. These symptoms are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by thiamine deficiency. The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of an alcoholic smell support this diagnosis. Other options like hypoglycemia, ethanol intoxication, and benzodiazepine intoxication do not match the neurological findings and history.

Answer: B",1770
20,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, malaise, night sweats, and enlarged axillary lymph nodes. These are common signs of lymphoma. The fine-needle aspiration suggests a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, which is characteristic of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Among the given options, travel to Africa is not directly linked to developing lymphoma. Axillary lymph node involvement is a symptom, not a risk factor. Previous radiation therapy and previous breast cancer are potential risk factors for developing lymphoma, but the most significant risk factor among the options provided is the history of previous breast cancer, especially given the treatment with radiation and chemotherapy.

Answer: D",2475
21,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 3-month-old infant with symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing during feeding, and overall lethargy. These symptoms, along with the presence of a high-pitched holosystolic murmur, suggest a congenital heart defect. DiGeorge syndrome, characterized by a 22q11.2 deletion, commonly includes congenital heart defects such as tetralogy of Fallot or truncus arteriosus, which can present with these symptoms. The other options are less likely given the specific symptoms and the presence of a murmur, which is more indicative of a structural heart issue rather than other conditions like lithium exposure or maternal alcohol consumption.

Answer: A",1994
22,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and a dry cough, which are nonspecific but suggest an infectious process. The presence of wheezes and a positive polysaccharide antigen test along with the findings from bronchoalveolar lavage (dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae) are key. Pneumocystis pneumonia typically does not present with these specific symptoms and the findings do not match its typical presentation. Legionella pneumophila infection can cause similar symptoms but does not typically produce a dimorphic fungus on bronchoalveolar lavage. Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis are both dimorphic fungi that can cause pulmonary infections, but the geographic location (Mississippi) and the clinical presentation are more consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, which is common in the southeastern United States.

Answer: B",2555
23,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient developed a fever and purulent cough after a week of hospitalization for a stroke, indicating a potential nosocomial infection. The presence of basal crackles on the right side of the chest and consolidation on chest radiography suggest a bacterial pneumonia. Among the options, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus can all cause pneumonia. However, the presence of neutrophils (72%) and bands (4%) suggests a recent bacterial infection, making Staphylococcus aureus more likely. Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically presents with chronic symptoms and is less likely to present acutely after a stroke. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are more common causes of community-acquired pneumonia but less likely given the context of a nosocomial infection and the acute presentation.

Answer: D",1715
24,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's initial presentation suggests a severe asthma exacerbation, which improved with initial treatments but then worsened to a state of lethargy and tachycardia. The absence of wheezing on repeat examination and the presence of lethargy indicate a possible complication such as metabolic acidosis or rhabdomyolysis secondary to severe muscle breakdown, which can occur in severe asthma. Magnesium sulfate is used to prevent seizures in severe asthma, but the patient's condition has deteriorated. Given the patient's altered mental status and cardiovascular instability, intubation and mechanical ventilation are necessary to secure the airway and manage potential respiratory failure.

Answer: A",2403
25,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient has recurrent infections by multiple organisms, including Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus aureus. The nitroblue tetrazolium test indicates an inability to produce the microbicidal respiratory burst. Myeloperoxidase is involved in producing hypohalous acids for antimicrobial activity, and its deficiency would directly affect the ability to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst. Immunoglobulin class switching, superoxide dismutase, and respiratory burst are not directly related to the observed defect in this patient.

Answer: C",1355
26,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a 'cough-like-a-seal bark' and inspiratory stridor, which are classic symptoms of croup. The steeple sign, a radiographic finding of subglottic narrowing, is highly indicative of croup. The other options do not match the clinical presentation: increased interstitial markings suggest interstitial lung disease, lobar consolidation suggests bacterial pneumonia, and the thumbprint sign is associated with tracheal tumors. 

Answer: D",1935
27,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Rifampin is known to induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP3A4, leading to increased metabolism of various drugs. This would result in decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, which are key components of oral contraceptives, thus explaining the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient.

Answer: A",2212
28,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bloody diarrhea, fever, and now lower extremity weakness and tingling. These symptoms suggest a possible infectious cause such as Shigella or Salmonella infection, which can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS often presents with thrombotic microangiopathy, which can cause neurological symptoms like those described. The presence of hematuria and proteinuria in HUS can lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid protein levels. The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation and lack of specific neurological signs pointing towards meningitis or eosinophilia.

Answer: D",2455
29,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with an inward turning of the left forefoot, which is corrected by tickling the lateral border of the foot. This suggests a congenital talipes equinovarus (Clubfoot). The X-ray shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones, confirming the diagnosis. Immediate treatment involves a foot abduction brace to gradually correct the deformity. Arthrodesis and tarsometatarsal capsulotomy are surgical interventions used in severe cases, not for initial management. Reassurance alone is insufficient given the deformity.

Answer: A",2217
30,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right upper abdominal pain and nausea, which are common symptoms of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The elevated white blood cell count (14,000/mm³) suggests an inflammatory process, consistent with cholecystitis. The inconclusive ultrasonography and cholescintigraphy findings make other diagnoses less likely. 

- Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma (A) typically presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, often associated with pancreatitis, not just right upper quadrant pain.
- A fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine (B) would likely present with signs of sepsis and possibly jaundice, which are not mentioned.
- Infection with a hepatotropic virus (C) would usually present with more systemic symptoms and specific viral markers, not just localized right upper quadrant pain.
- Obstruction of the cystic duct (D) can cause cholecystitis and is consistent with the patient’s symptoms and laboratory findings.

Answer: D",2894
31,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shortness of breath and palpitations, indicating potential heart failure or impaired cardiac function. The pressure-volume loop shows abnormal patterns compared to a normal one, suggesting a problem with the left ventricle's performance. 

- Mitral valve regurgitation would primarily affect diastolic filling but not necessarily the overall shape of the pressure-volume loop.
- Increased systemic vascular resistance would lead to higher afterload but not directly alter the ventricular pressure-volume relationship.
- Impaired left ventricular contractility would result in a reduced ejection fraction and a characteristic ""sloping"" pattern in the pressure-volume loop, consistent with the given abnormal loop.

Answer: D",1427
32,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, rigors, night sweats, and progressive fatigue, along with petechiae and ecchymoses. These symptoms suggest a possible sepsis or infection with a resistant organism. Blood cultures grew coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are commonly found in the normal flora and rarely cause severe infections unless they are part of a more serious condition like endocarditis or bacteremia. Given the patient's history of recent travel to Guatemala and previous treatment for meningitis, the infection might be due to a resistant strain of bacteria. 

- Doxycycline is not typically used for treating resistant staphylococcal infections.
- Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is effective against many bacteria but not specifically against staphylococci.
- Linezolid is effective against Gram-positive bacteria including resistant staphylococci.
- Chloramphenicol, while historically used for resistant organisms, is not commonly used for this purpose anymore due to side effects and resistance issues.

Answer: C",1776
33,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with weight loss and pitting pedal edema. Endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus, and biopsy reveals parietal cell atrophy. These findings suggest a diagnosis of pernicious anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which is caused by autoimmune destruction of parietal cells. This condition leads to decreased acid production and intrinsic factor, resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12. None of the other options (serotonin-secreting tumor, mucus-producing cell proliferation, or excessive somatostatin secretion) are directly related to the described symptoms and endoscopic/biopsy findings.

Answer: D",1476
34,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient initially presented with hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, which are classic signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The initial treatment included insulin, potassium, and IV fluids to manage these conditions. After treatment, the patient's glucose level normalized, but the potassium level remains elevated. Given the patient's history of IV drug abuse and the need to continue managing electrolyte imbalances, the best next step is to ensure proper hydration and continued monitoring of electrolytes.

Answer: A",2224
35,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's history includes right knee swelling and pain, difficulty walking, back pain, and dandruff. Pitting of the nails is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis. The patient's pain improves with rest, which is common in rheumatoid arthritis but less specific. Arthritis mutilans is rare and involves severe joint damage, not commonly associated with dandruff. Mixed connective tissue disease can share features with other connective tissue diseases but does not specifically correlate with the nail changes seen here. Given the nail pitting and dandruff, psoriatic arthritis is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A",2237
36,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is a 65-year-old woman with weight loss, weakness, and bladder incontinence. These symptoms do not align with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which primarily affects boys and presents with muscle weakness starting in early childhood. Hypothyroidism typically causes generalized fatigue and weight gain, not specific muscle weakness or incontinence. Myasthenia gravis usually presents with fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability, but it does not commonly cause weight loss or incontinence. Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung can present with weight loss, generalized weakness, and autonomic dysfunction like incontinence, making it the most likely cause.

Answer: D",1883
37,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and RSV pneumonia, indicating recurrent infections. SCID often presents with these symptoms due to a severely compromised immune system affecting both T and B cells. Defective isotype switching and selective IgA deficiency typically present with recurrent infections but do not explain the broad spectrum of symptoms including RSV pneumonia and oral candidiasis. HIV PCR was negative, ruling out that condition. Therefore, the most likely cause is defective T cell function in combination with B cell dysfunction, characteristic of SCID.

Answer: A",1920
38,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The therapeutic index is defined as the ratio of the effective dose (ED) to the toxic dose (TD). From the data, the 40 mg dose shows a high efficacy (46/51 patients improved) with a relatively low toxicity (11/51 adverse events), suggesting it is the optimal dose. The therapeutic index can be calculated as ED50/TD50, where ED50 is the dose that produces a 50% response and TD50 is the dose that causes a 50% adverse effect. Here, the 40 mg dose is close to both, making it the best candidate. The therapeutic index is then calculated as 40 mg / 40 mg = 1. However, since the question asks for the most likely therapeutic index and the closest value to the calculated one from the given options, the answer is 2.5.

Answer: C",2860
39,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is fluent in speech and can comprehend instructions but remains unable to repeat phrases. This pattern of deficits suggests a disruption in the arcuate fasciculus, which connects Broca's area and Wernicke's area, crucial for verbal repetition. The superior temporal gyrus is involved in comprehension, and the inferior frontal gyrus is involved in speech production. Since the patient can comprehend and produce fluent speech but cannot repeat, the arcuate fasciculus is most likely damaged.

Answer: A",1743
40,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe inflammatory acne, unwanted facial hair, and a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These symptoms are characteristic of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is commonly associated with insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances leading to acne and hirsutism. Hypothyroidism typically causes weight gain, fatigue, and cold intolerance, which are not prominent in this case. Idiopathic hirsutism alone does not explain the acne and other symptoms. Ovarian hyperthecosis is less common and usually presents with more pronounced virilization and elevated androgen levels, which are not the primary concerns here.

Answer: C",1949
41,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with tingling and numbness in the lower limbs, persistent leg pain, decreased sensation to pain, and elevated blood sugars. These symptoms suggest peripheral neuropathy due to poorly controlled diabetes. Atorvastatin is used for lipid management and does not address the underlying neuropathy. Femoro-iliac artery bypass is indicated for peripheral arterial disease, not neuropathy. Strict blood glucose control can improve neuropathic symptoms and prevent further nerve damage. Amputation is a last resort for severe complications and not indicated here. 

Answer: C",2618
42,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilious vomiting, which suggests an obstruction higher than the duodenum. The absence of meconium passage indicates no significant distal obstruction. The high amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm and the laboratory findings (decreased AFP, increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A) are consistent with Down syndrome, a condition often associated with duodenal atresia. Meconium ileus and necrotizing enterocolitis typically present with more severe abdominal distension and signs of infection, while pyloric stenosis usually presents with projectile vomiting without bile.

Answer: A",2566
43,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The inferior vena cava returns deoxygenated blood from the body to the right atrium, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium, and the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. The pulmonary vein, on the other hand, carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium. Therefore, both the inferior vena cava and the coronary sinus contain deoxygenated blood, but the pulmonary artery contains deoxygenated blood before it reaches the lungs and oxygenated blood after. Thus, the pulmonary artery will have the lowest oxygen content at both time points.

Answer: C",1199
44,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increasingly heavy periods, irregular cycles, intermenstrual bleeding, significant dysmenorrhea, and pelvic heaviness. These symptoms are consistent with endometriosis, a condition where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. The presence of endometriosis can lead to an enlarged and tender uterus, which might feel globular. Additionally, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a specific adnexal mass or an irregular uterus size. Given the chronic nature of her symptoms and the physical findings, a globular uterus is the most likely physical exam finding.

Answer: A",2866
45,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include erratic behavior, confusion, slurred speech, ataxia, and metabolic acidosis (low pH, low HCO3, high PaCO2). These findings suggest a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or ethanol withdrawal, but the urinalysis and normal salicylate levels rule out DKA and ethylene glycol/methanol poisoning. Naltrexone is used for alcohol and opioid addiction, and naloxone is used for opioid overdose. Since the urinalysis is normal and there is no indication of opioid use, these options are unlikely. Fomepizole is used for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, which can cause similar symptoms but is ruled out by the normal urinalysis and salicylate levels. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is ethanol to block alcohol metabolism and prevent further production of toxic metabolites.

Answer: D",1842
46,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The number needed to treat (NNT) is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). First, calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR):

\[ \text{ARR} = \frac{\text{Number of events in control group} - \text{Number of events in experimental group}}{\text{Total number of subjects in control group}} \]

\[ \text{ARR} = \frac{210 - 134}{1500} = \frac{76}{1500} \approx 0.0507 \]

Then, calculate the NNT:

\[ \text{NNT} = \frac{1}{\text{ARR}} \approx \frac{1}{0.0507} \approx 19.7 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 20.

Answer: C",1430
47,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with tingling pain in the sole of the right foot when raising the leg, calf cramping on the treadmill, and absent right pedal pulses. These symptoms suggest arterial insufficiency rather than nerve compression. Lumbar spinal stenosis typically causes pain in the low back or buttocks, not specifically in the foot, and would not cause absent pedal pulses. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis and aortoiliac artery stenosis can both cause absent pedal pulses, but the specific symptom of tingling pain in the foot with leg elevation is more indicative of femoropopliteal artery stenosis. Acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein would present with more localized swelling and pain, not generalized symptoms like cramping and absent pulses.

Answer: A",2202
48,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Given the absence of fetal heartbeats, movement, and respiration, and the presence of decreased amniotic fluid levels, the scenario describes a stillbirth. The most appropriate next step is to recommend an autopsy of the infant to determine the cause of death, which can provide important information for future pregnancies and health management.

Answer: B",1892
49,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient developed ARDS after influenza A infection, which led to severe lung damage. ARDS involves extensive alveolar damage and subsequent repair. Option A refers to ciliated cells, which are primarily involved in clearing debris from the airways, not in alveolar repair. Option B involves excess mucus production by goblet cells, which is more relevant to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Option D, club cells, are stem cells that can differentiate into multiple cell types, including type I and type II alveolar cells, and are crucial for alveolar repair. Option C specifically mentions surfactant-secreting cells, which are type II alveolar cells that produce surfactant but do not regenerate alveolar lining. Therefore, the primary process involved in regenerating the alveolar lining is the proliferation of club cells.

Answer: D",2386
50,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: External beam radiation primarily affects cancer cells by inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA, which leads to cell death due to the disruption of essential cellular processes. Thymidine dimers and deamination of cytosine are mechanisms of UV light-induced DNA damage, not radiation. Disulfide bonds are not directly induced by radiation but can form as a secondary effect due to oxidative stress. Therefore, the primary mechanism of radiation-induced DNA damage is breaks in double-stranded DNA.
Answer: D",2239
51,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps, along with hypertension. The laboratory values show hypokalemia (low potassium) and metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate). These findings are consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism, where there is aldosterone excess leading to potassium loss and metabolic alkalosis. The other options are less likely because:
- Catecholamine-secreting mass would typically present with symptoms like headache, palpitations, and hypertension but not primarily with muscle cramps and hypokalemia.
- Cortisol excess (Cushing syndrome) would cause central obesity, moon face, and buffalo hump, not muscle cramps.
- Impaired kidney perfusion would not typically cause metabolic alkalosis.

Answer: A",2266
52,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with jaundice and generalized pruritus, along with elevated bilirubin and low urobilinogen in the urine. Elevated bilirubin suggests hyperbilirubinemia, while low urobilinogen indicates impaired bile excretion rather than increased hemoglobin breakdown (which would elevate urobilinogen). Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity would lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without significant pruritus. Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption would not typically cause low urobilinogen in the urine. Therefore, the most likely cause is defective hepatic bile excretion.

Answer: D",2105
53,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include vomiting, mild crampy abdominal pain, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea. These symptoms suggest a cholinergic excess, likely due to the cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine. Atropine (A) is an anticholinergic that can counteract cholinergic effects. Bethanechol (A) is a cholinergic agonist and would worsen the symptoms. Metoclopramide (B) is a dopamine antagonist that can help with nausea but does not address the cholinergic excess. Oxybutynin (D) is an anticholinergic for overactive bladder and would not be appropriate for these symptoms.

Answer: C",1330
54,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include lip smacking, pursing of the mouth, and excessive blinking, which are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia. These symptoms started slowly and have worsened over time, fitting the profile of tardive dyskinesia. Acute dystonia typically presents with more rigid and painful muscle spasms, pseudoparkinsonism involves bradykinesia and rigidity, and palsy refers to a loss of muscle function, none of which match the described symptoms. 

Answer: A",1620
55,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scaling in the groin area, consistent with psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that often appears in specific areas and can be triggered by skin injury. The other options (KOH, Nikolsky's sign, Gram stain, and AFB stain) are used to diagnose fungal infections, blistering conditions, and mycobacterial infections, respectively, none of which align with the presentation of psoriasis.

Answer: A",1733
56,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Risperidone is known to cause several side effects, including weight gain, gynecomastia, and agranulocytosis. However, the patient's history of being otherwise healthy and the context of the question suggest that unexplained weight loss is less likely. The shortened QT interval is more commonly associated with antipsychotics like clozapine, not risperidone. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect is gynecomastia.

Answer: C",1687
57,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, altered mental status, petechial rash, nausea, and vomiting, along with heavy menstrual bleeding. These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can be caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). In HUS, the Shiga toxin binds to the variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor, leading to activation and subsequent damage to endothelial cells.

Answer: B",1299
58,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with pallor, lethargy, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and scleral icterus. These symptoms are consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can present with gastrointestinal symptoms followed by hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. The presence of schistocytes in the blood smear further supports this diagnosis. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) typically does not present with hemolytic anemia or significant thrombocytopenia. Henoch-Schönlein purpura usually presents with purpuric rash rather than hemolytic anemia. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) would be less likely given the recent history of gastrointestinal symptoms and the absence of neurological symptoms.

Answer: C",2619
59,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient's history of induced vomiting and concerns about weight gain despite regular dental visits for caries fits the criteria for bulimia nervosa, not orthorexia nervosa. Orthorexia nervosa focuses on the quality of food rather than the quantity or purging behaviors. Therefore, the options related to orthorexia nervosa being a distinct disorder without subtypes, patients not initiating treatment, or having a specific BMI range are not relevant to this case.

Answer: C",1779
60,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, chills, abdominal pain, and a maculopapular rash, which are consistent with a systemic infection. The presence of a salmon-colored maculopapular rash is characteristic of schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni. Additionally, the patient recently returned from Indonesia, a known endemic area for schistosomiasis. The other options are less likely: Giardia lamblia typically causes watery diarrhea without fever or hepatosplenomegaly; Clostridium perfringens usually presents with localized symptoms like gas gangrene or severe food poisoning; Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever but does not typically present with a maculopapular rash.

Answer: B",1743
61,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Metronidazole is an antibiotic used to treat anaerobic bacterial infections and protozoal infections, such as those causing vaginitis. The symptoms experienced by the patient (facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps) are consistent with the disulfiram-like reaction, also known as the ""double drunk"" syndrome, which can occur when metronidazole is combined with alcohol. This reaction is primarily due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol. Uric acid levels may be elevated in conditions like gout but are not directly related to the alcohol reaction. Cytochrome P-450 enzymes are involved in drug metabolism but are not directly affected by alcohol in this context. Amylase is involved in digestion and is not relevant here.

Answer: A",1837
62,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, which is a common symptom of anemia. The complete blood count shows a low hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.1 g/dL and a hematocrit (HCT) of 32%, indicating anemia. The reticulocyte count is low (0.2%), suggesting that the anemia is not due to recent blood loss or hemolysis. The MCV of 90 fL is within the normal range, ruling out macrocytic anemia (e.g., due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency). Therefore, no specific tests are required beyond confirming the anemia and assessing the underlying cause.

Answer: D",2077
63,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has not passed urine since his surgery and a bladder scan is inconclusive due to his body habitus. This suggests a possible urinary retention. Given the patient's history of autonomic dysreflexia (as indicated by the need for pre-treatment with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine before surgery) and the presence of abdominal and pelvic discomfort, it is crucial to rule out any triggering stimuli that could be causing autonomic dysreflexia. A digital rectal exam (DRE) can help identify any obstruction or other issues in the lower urinary tract or pelvis.

Answer: C",3009
64,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with painless white patches in the mouth that can be easily wiped away, revealing erythematous mucosa. This presentation is consistent with oral candidiasis, commonly caused by Candida species. The most appropriate treatment for candidiasis involves disrupting fungal cell wall synthesis, which is achieved by inhibiting beta-glucan synthase.

Answer: D",1994
65,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's subacute back pain, particularly worsening at night, and the presence of point tenderness along the lumbosacral area, suggest a possible metastatic process. Given the patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer, which was treated a year ago, metastasis to the lumbar spine is a plausible explanation. A bulging disc or narrowing of the disc space would typically present with more radicular symptoms and are less likely given the localized pain. Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine are less common and not strongly suggested by the clinical presentation.

Answer: B",2090
66,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 4-year-old with severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and a distended abdomen with tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness. These findings suggest a possible bowel obstruction or perforation, which requires urgent surgical intervention. The surgeon has already recommended an emergency laparotomy. Given that the parents are not available and cannot be reached, obtaining consent from the patient's brother is not legally sufficient. Delaying surgery until parental consent is obtained would be inappropriate as it could worsen the patient's condition. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to proceed with the emergency laparotomy.

Answer: C",1837
67,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include poor weight gain, irritability, diaphoresis, and a paucity of subcutaneous fat, which are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The mother's history of Graves' disease and recent thyroid surgery suggest a transplacental passage of autoantibodies. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) antibodies can cause hyperthyroidism in neonates, but TSH receptor antibodies are more commonly associated with neonatal Graves' disease. Viral infections and opiate use do not typically present with these specific symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause is transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.

Answer: B",2605
68,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bright red blood in the vomitus and black tarry stools, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding likely due to esophageal varices secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism. The presence of splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave further supports portal hypertension and the need for treatment of the underlying cause. Octreotide was administered during endoscopy, which is used to reduce portal hypertension and control bleeding from varices. Phentolamine is a non-selective α-adrenergic antagonist and would not be indicated in this scenario as it does not address the underlying portal hypertension. Prazosin is an α1-adrenergic receptor blocker, nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, and nadolol is a β-adrenergic blocker. Among these, nadolol (D) is the most appropriate as it can help reduce portal hypertension and control bleeding from esophageal varices.

Answer: D",2863
69,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and now presents with a new liver nodule on imaging that enhances in the arterial phase but not in the venous or delayed phases, which is consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given the small size (2 cm) and the presence of cirrhosis, the most appropriate next step is to refer for surgical resection if the lesion is amenable, as it offers the best chance for cure.

Answer: B",2485
70,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, somnolence, hyperreflexia, and asterixis, all consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of ascites and liver cirrhosis further supports this diagnosis. The ammonia level is elevated, which is a key indicator of hepatic encephalopathy. While spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can cause similar symptoms, there is no evidence of an acute infection (no fever, no signs of peritonitis). Metabolic alkalosis and portal vein thrombosis do not explain the clinical presentation, and hypoglycemia is unlikely given the normal glucose level.

Answer: A",2920
71,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a history of blunt trauma, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated troponins. These findings are consistent with a cardiac contusion, where the heart muscle is injured from the impact of the collision. Pulmonary contusion would not explain the elevated troponins, and hemorrhage alone does not account for the cardiac findings. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically presents with acute stress and a normal ECG, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a cardiac contusion.

Answer: A",2130
72,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include progressive fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain, along with hepatomegaly, ascites, and elevated white blood cell count, indicating a severe liver condition. The presence of ascites and a positive culture for E. coli suggests bacterial peritonitis. The oliguria and hyponatremia indicate the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a complication of severe liver disease where renal function deteriorates due to portal hypertension and systemic vasodilation. Given the severity and the lack of response to initial treatments, liver transplantation is the most appropriate option for this patient.

Answer: C",2696
73,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with weight loss, palpitations, warm and moist skin, and fine hand tremors, all consistent with hyperthyroidism. Methimazole is the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism, particularly in Graves' disease. Glucocorticoids are used for conditions like autoimmune disorders but are not indicated here. Propranolol can manage symptoms like tremors and palpitations but is not a primary treatment for hyperthyroidism. Radioiodine therapy is effective but is typically used after other treatments fail or are inappropriate.

Answer: B",1713
74,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include pruritus and a hypopigmented rash that started as a single lesion on the upper back and has extended to the shoulders. These symptoms are consistent with a fungal infection, particularly tinea corporis, which is common in tropical climates like the Bahamas. 

- **Wood lamp examination**: This can help identify fungal infections by revealing fluorescence under ultraviolet light, making it a good diagnostic tool for fungal conditions.
- **Skin culture**: While useful for identifying the specific fungus, it would not provide immediate results and is more confirmatory than diagnostic.
- **Potassium hydroxide preparation**: Used to identify fungi in scrapings, but the patient's symptoms suggest a larger area involvement, making this less suitable.
- **Skin biopsy**: Invasive and typically used when other methods are inconclusive.

Given the context and the need for a quick, non-invasive method to confirm the diagnosis, a Wood lamp examination is the most appropriate initial test.

Answer: A",2459
75,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has multiple congenital anomalies including a high-pitched mewing cry, microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur. These findings are characteristic of a chromosomal disorder such as Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), which commonly presents with these features. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) typically does not present with a high-pitched mewing cry. Trisomy 7 and the number 5 itself do not have specific syndromes associated with these exact findings. Therefore, the most likely chromosome involved is 18.

Answer: C",2030
76,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with vaginal spotting and an immobile erythematous mass on the right inner vaginal wall. These symptoms suggest a possible malignancy given the patient's age and the presence of a palpable mass. A Pap smear alone may not be sufficient to diagnose a mass, and incision and drainage would be inappropriate without first establishing the nature of the mass. Urine tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia are not indicated based on the clinical presentation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a biopsy to determine the nature of the mass.

Answer: B",2111
77,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with joint pain, swelling, and tenderness over multiple metacarpophalangeal joints, along with characteristic radiographic findings such as beak-like osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and osteopenia. These findings are consistent with osteoarthritis. Additionally, the lab studies show high transferrin saturation and elevated ferritin, which suggest hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis can cause systemic inflammation and joint pain but does not typically present with the crystal deposition diseases or pathogenic inoculation of microbes. 

Answer: C",1413
78,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The newborn is extremely cyanotic, develops progressive respiratory failure, and has an enlarged ""egg-shaped"" heart with a single loud S2 heart sound and a machine-like murmur. These findings are consistent with persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), where there is one arterial trunk supplying both systemic and pulmonary circulation, leading to cyanosis and an enlarged heart. Coarctation of the aorta typically presents with hypertension in the upper body and hypotension in the lower body, tricuspid atresia involves a lack of right atrioventricular connection without the described arterial anomalies, and transposition of great vessels involves a switch in the position of the aorta and pulmonary artery, which does not fit the described findings. 

Answer: B",1989
79,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a penetrating wound to the chest with significant hemodynamic instability, indicating potential cardiac involvement. Transthoracic echocardiography confirms a full-thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, which requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent further hemorrhage and potential cardiac dysfunction. Immediate cardiac transplant (Option A) is not indicated for this acute, traumatic injury. Watchful waiting (Option B) is inappropriate given the patient's unstable condition. Needle thoracostomy (Option D) is used for pneumothorax or hemothorax management, not for repairing a cardiac defect. Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures (Option C) can be used for closing the wound but are insufficient for stabilizing a cardiac injury.

Answer: C",2417
80,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient has chronic lower extremity edema, a long smoking history, and a productive cough. These symptoms suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other chronic lung conditions. Hypereosinophilia (Option A) is not directly related to these symptoms. Reid Index > 50% (Option B) typically indicates chronic bronchitis, which is less likely given the hypereosinophilic context. Non-caseating granulomas (Option C) are more indicative of conditions like sarcoidosis, which is not suggested by the patient’s history. Evidence of a necrotizing infection (Option D) is not consistent with the described chronic and non-infectious presentation.

Answer: A",1783
81,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include chronic fatigue and enlarged nodules, which suggest a potential neoplastic process. The biopsy showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18 points towards a specific genetic alteration. Given the context of the question, the most relevant protein regulation would be related to cell cycle control and proliferation, which aligns with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Caspase-9 is involved in apoptosis, and there is no indication of increased cell death. CD15 is not a standard term for any known protein in this context. Ras pathway transcription factors are involved in signal transduction but do not directly relate to the given symptoms.

Answer: C",2000
82,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient is an African-American woman, which is less common for melanoma compared to Caucasians. However, she has a family history of metastatic melanoma, increasing her risk. The description mentions no abnormal moles or warts, ruling out nodular or desmoplastic melanoma, which often present as raised, firm lesions. Acral lentiginous melanoma typically affects the palms, soles, and nail beds, which is not indicated here. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type in African-Americans and presents as a flat, pigmented lesion that can be easily overlooked. Given the absence of other specific presentations and the family history, superficial spreading melanoma is the most likely type.

Answer: D",1604
83,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include difficulty combing her hair in the mornings and a stiff neck with bilateral shoulder tenderness. These symptoms are more consistent with giant-cell arteritis, which often presents with tender, stiff neck and temporal artery tenderness. Jaw claudication is specifically related to giant-cell arteritis, while the other options do not match the given symptoms.

Answer: A",2539
84,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient reports episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea, which suggests an inflammatory or immune-related condition. The regularity of her menstrual cycle and normal pelvic exams suggest that the reproductive organs are intact. The history of multiple episodes over several years, along with the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, points towards an immune-mediated condition like endometriosis. Endometriosis can cause pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The other options are less likely given the normal findings and the absence of specific signs of infection or tumors.

Answer: C",1898
85,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of tricuspid valve replacement and current symptoms including fever, weakness, and nail bed hemorrhages. These findings suggest infective endocarditis, particularly given the presence of friable irregular masses attached to the valve, which are characteristic of this condition. Bicuspid valve and papillary muscle rupture are not directly related to the current symptoms, and annular calcification is less likely to present acutely with these findings.

Answer: B",1990
86,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) and cyclic pelvic pain, which are common symptoms of endometriosis. The presence of rectovaginal tenderness and the history of irregular pain despite oral contraceptives suggest endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasound did not show abnormalities, but laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis. Measurement of CA-125 levels is not specific enough for endometriosis, hysterectomy is too aggressive for this stage, and hysteroscopy is not indicated for this condition.

Answer: C",1941
87,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a high LDL-cholesterol level, which is a direct indication for treatment. While the blood pressure reading is elevated, it is not yet at a critical level requiring immediate treatment. The patient's weight and overall sedentary lifestyle are important factors for lifestyle modification but do not require specific medical treatment based on the given lab results. The serum glucose level is slightly elevated but not at a level indicating diabetes.
Answer: C",2959
88,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has severe facial lacerations, respiratory distress, and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. These findings suggest a significant chest injury. The x-ray shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. These findings are consistent with a traumatic bronchial rupture, where the bronchus is torn, leading to air leakage into the pleural space and mediastinum. Diaphragmatic rupture would typically present with abdominal symptoms and a more pronounced shift in the mediastinum. Thoracic aortic rupture would present with more systemic signs like hypotension and shock without the specific findings of bronchial injury. Tension pneumothorax would show a more pronounced tracheal deviation and hyperresonance on percussion.

Answer: B",2569
89,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is 10 weeks pregnant and has symptoms of hyperthyroidism including anxiety, palpitations, and fatigue. Her TSH is very low (0.01 µU/mL) and FT4 is elevated, indicating hyperthyroidism. Given her pregnancy, radioiodine therapy (option C) and thyroidectomy (option D) are not suitable as they can cause fetal radiation exposure and complications during pregnancy, respectively. Methimazole (option A) is contraindicated in the first trimester due to potential teratogenic effects. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred treatment in the first trimester of pregnancy for hyperthyroidism due to its better safety profile compared to methimazole.

Answer: B",2126
90,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include intermittent loose stools, weight loss, diffuse abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly, and eosinophilia. The stool culture shows oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines, which are characteristic of Schistosoma eggs. Freshwater snails are intermediate hosts for Schistosoma species, facilitating the transmission of the parasite. The other options (undercooked pork, undercooked fish, and dog feces) are not associated with the presence of Schistosoma eggs or the described clinical presentation.

Answer: D",1644
91,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: Tetralogy of Fallot includes pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and overriding aorta. The tricuspid valve is not typically involved in these findings, so option A is incorrect. Option B discusses hemoglobin levels and iron deficiency anemia, which is not directly related to the specific conditions of tetralogy of Fallot. Option C compares cerebral arterial thrombosis to cerebral venous thrombosis, neither of which are commonly associated with tetralogy of Fallot. Option D mentions refractory heart failure, which can be a complication of tetralogy of Fallot due to chronic hypoxemia and right-to-left shunting. 

Answer: D",1822
92,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is agitated and confused, with fluctuating levels of consciousness, and requires frequent reorientation. These symptoms are consistent with delirium, which often presents with fluctuations in attention and awareness. The patient's age and recent surgery increase the risk for delirium. There is no evidence of a urinary tract infection (normal urine dipstick), and the patient's history of moderate alcohol use does not suggest opioid intoxication. Dementia typically presents with a gradual decline in cognitive function and is less likely to have the sudden onset and fluctuating nature of her symptoms.

Answer: C",2684
93,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a past medical history of mental retardation, which aligns with Down syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays and characteristic physical features. The sudden onset of ataxia and altered responsiveness, along with spasticity and positive Babinski sign, suggest a neurological condition. The ""clunk"" on cervical spine manipulation indicates potential spinal involvement. Among the given options, Down syndrome is the most likely risk factor predisposing this patient to these symptoms.

Answer: C",2605
94,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has signs of hemothorax, including muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and a drop in blood pressure with inspiration. A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration (Option C) is a classic sign of hemothorax, where blood compresses the lung, reducing its capacity to expand during inspiration and causing a drop in blood pressure.

Answer: C",2059
95,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has poorly controlled hypertension and bilateral flank masses, along with elevated creatinine levels. These findings suggest possible renovascular hypertension or renal artery stenosis. The palpable flank masses could indicate a renal mass, which could be related to conditions like renal cell carcinoma. Given these clinical findings, a renal ultrasound already ordered, and the need to rule out renal artery stenosis, a more specific imaging modality like MR angiography of the renal arteries would be most appropriate to screen for additional complications.

Answer: D",2461
96,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemoptysis (blood in sputum), which are symptoms often associated with pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary emboli are typically caused by blood clots in the pulmonary arteries, often originating from deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The presence of a filling defect in the pulmonary vessels strongly suggests a clot. While the blood tests returned to normal after treatment, this does not indicate the mode of inheritance but rather the effectiveness of the treatment. Given that the condition is not related to sex chromosomes and does not follow a pattern of dominant or recessive traits in families, it is unlikely to be X-linked dominant or recessive. The most common cause of PE is venous thromboembolism, which does not follow a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. Therefore, the most likely mode of inheritance is not applicable to this specific condition.

Answer: A",1866
97,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient had a gram-negative diplococcal urethritis that responded to antibiotics but recurred a year later. This suggests the organism may have undergone antigenic variation, allowing it to evade the immune response. The other options are less likely: exotoxin release would cause persistent symptoms rather than recurrence after treatment; a polysaccharide capsule might contribute to initial infection but not recurrent episodes; and Bruton's agammaglobulinemia would lead to a primary immunodeficiency, making recurrent infections unlikely if the patient had been treated effectively once.

Answer: B",1828
98,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient reports significant neck pain after a motor vehicle accident but denies any neurological deficits. Given the mechanism of injury and the presence of neck pain, cervical spine injury cannot be ruled out. Cervical immobilization is essential to prevent potential spinal cord injury. A lateral cervical film would be more appropriate if there were clinical suspicion of instability or fracture, which is not indicated here. IV methylprednisolone is used in cases of suspected spinal cord injury to reduce inflammation, but it is not the initial step. Observation overnight without cervical immobilization could be considered if there is low suspicion of cervical spine injury, but given the mechanism of injury, cervical immobilization is the most appropriate immediate step.

Answer: B",1954
99,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Haloperidol, bromocriptine, fluphenazine, and risperidone are all known to cause side effects that can lead to galactorrhea and decreased libido. However, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist primarily used to treat conditions like prolactinomas and hyperprolactinemia, which can directly cause galactorrhea without the need for a psychiatric medication. The other options (haloperidol, fluphenazine, and risperidone) are antipsychotics that can indirectly cause these symptoms through their effects on dopamine pathways. Given the context, bromocriptine is the least likely to be the cause of the symptoms since it is not typically used as a first-line antipsychotic.

Answer: B",1959
100,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient is a 2-day-old male with jaundice, and his older brother has sickle cell disease. The maternal blood group is Rh-negative, and there is an anti-Rh antibody titer. The direct bilirubin level is low, indicating that the jaundice is likely due to unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. 

- Option A (RBC sickling): While the brother has sickle cell disease, there is no evidence of sickling in this newborn.
- Option B (Anti-D antibodies): The mother is Rh-negative and has anti-Rh antibodies, but the fetus is Rh-negative, so this is unlikely to be the cause.
- Option C (Biliary duct malformation): This would typically present with higher direct bilirubin levels and other signs of liver dysfunction, which are not present here.
- Option D (Anti-B antibodies): There is no indication of blood type incompatibility affecting this patient.

Answer: C",1780
101,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Parkinson's disease, including rigidity, slowness in performing tasks, rest tremor, and a shuffling gait. These symptoms are characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Amantadine is used for influenza and dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism, but it is not an antiviral. Ribavirin is an antiviral used for RSV, HCV, and hemorrhagic fevers. Zidovudine is used for HIV. Levodopa is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease and is often used in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that an antiviral was prescribed, the most likely drug prescribed is Levodopa.

Answer: C",2529
102,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient is given prophylactic labetalol and magnesium sulfate, and now has absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Labetalol can cause hypotension and bradycardia, but it does not typically cause absent deep tendon reflexes. Magnesium sulfate can cause hypotension and respiratory depression, but its primary effect on reflexes is not typically absent reflexes. Absent deep tendon reflexes suggest a more serious neurological issue such as a metabolic disturbance like hypokalemia or hypermagnesemia. Stopping magnesium sulfate and giving calcium gluconate would address potential hypermagnesemia, while stopping labetalol would not directly address the absent reflexes. Lorazepam is used for sedation and anxiety, not for treating absent reflexes. Nerve conduction studies are diagnostic and not a treatment.

Answer: C",2140
103,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and non-pitting edema, which are classic signs of myxedema coma. The low sodium level and low thyroid hormone levels (TSH and T4) further support this diagnosis. Pheochromocytoma crisis would present with hypertension, not hypotension. Septic shock would typically present with fever and leukocytosis, not hypothermia and bradycardia. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism would not explain the hypothermia and bradycardia.

Answer: A",2851
104,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, and a physical exam revealing an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex. These findings are consistent with aortic regurgitation (AR), where the early diastolic blowing murmur is heard at the left sternal border and the midsystolic murmur is heard at the right upper sternal border. The presence of an S3 gallop further supports AR. Mitral regurgitation would present with a late diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex, which is not seen here. Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur and not a diastolic murmur. Mitral prolapse usually presents with a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur, not fitting the described murmurs.

Answer: B",1823
105,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of multiple turbulent relationships, impulsivity, and attempts to manipulate others' feelings align more closely with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). BPD is characterized by instability in relationships, fear of abandonment, and emotional dysregulation, which are evident in the patient's behavior. While histrionic personality disorder (HPD) involves attention-seeking behaviors, the patient's actions are more driven by fear and manipulation rather than seeking attention. Dependent personality disorder (DPD) involves a need for excessive reassurance and fear of abandonment, but the patient's behavior suggests more active manipulation rather than dependency. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) involves grandiosity and entitlement, which are not prominent in the patient's description.

Answer: B",2289
106,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a small, calcified nodule in the right middle lobe that has remained stable in size over a year. Given its benign appearance and stable nature, further invasive procedures are not immediately warranted. A PET scan is typically used for more indeterminate nodules or those suspected of being malignant. A lobectomy is an extreme measure for a stable, benign-appearing nodule. Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy is also invasive and unnecessary for a stable, calcified nodule. A repeat CT in 24 months can monitor the nodule for any changes.

Answer: A",2249
107,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has characteristics of Klinefelter syndrome, including tall stature, long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. The increased FSH and estradiol:testosterone ratio suggest impaired spermatogenesis. Klinefelter syndrome is caused by an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). This chromosomal abnormality is typically inherited from the mother, not the father. The error most likely occurred during meiosis I when the secondary oocyte should have received an X chromosome but instead received an X and an X, resulting in an extra X in the sperm. This aligns with the formation of the primary spermatocyte. 

Answer: A",1429
108,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is a 13-year-old boy with severe pain in the knee, hip, and groin, unable to bear weight on his left leg and limited hip range of motion. These symptoms suggest a possible hip dislocation or subluxation, which would explain the inability to bear weight and limited range of motion. 

- Option A (Casting and crutches): While useful for fractures, it does not address the specific issue of hip dislocation.
- Option B (Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness): This is commonly used for developmental dysplasia of the hip in younger children, but not typically for acute hip dislocation in older children.
- Option C (Supportive therapy and observation): This is insufficient given the severity of the symptoms and the need for immediate stabilization.
- Option D (Surgical pinning of the femoral head): This is too invasive and not indicated for an initial assessment; conservative measures should be tried first.

Answer: D",2010
109,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, along with a history of a painful rash on the lower extremity. These symptoms suggest a possible inflammatory process or underlying condition affecting the colon. Melanosis coli, while benign, can be associated with chronic inflammation or irritation of the colon. Given the patient's symptoms and the context of potential chronic irritation, melanosis coli is a plausible finding. There is no indication of increased VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide), stool leukocytes, or normal intestinal mucosa based on the provided information.

Answer: C",2355
110,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, confusion, and hepatic encephalopathy. His history includes hepatitis C, recurrent pancreatitis, and ascites. The paracentesis results show an albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL, indicating hypoalbuminemia, and a high leukocyte count with neutrophils, suggesting infection. These findings are consistent with bacterial translocation, where bacteria from the gut translocate into the bloodstream, leading to sepsis and systemic inflammatory response. This process can explain the fever, abdominal pain, and the presence of ascitic fluid with elevated neutrophils.

Answer: C",2543
111,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of a barking cough, hoarseness, high-pitched inspiratory stridor, and difficulty breathing are consistent with croup. The absence of fever spikes, significant distress, or signs of bacterial infection makes systemic antibiotics unnecessary. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are commonly used for croup due to their effectiveness in reducing airway inflammation and improving breathing. Given the severity of the symptoms, racemic epinephrine can provide rapid relief of stridor. 

Answer: B",2610
112,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include retrosternal burning with eating, which suggests acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This symptom is commonly associated with decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. The episodic hand pain in winter and chronic cough with dyspnea are less directly related to the esophageal issue and more to potential Raynaud's phenomenon or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively. 

Answer: A",1893
113,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, shortness of breath, and pallor, indicative of anemia. His hemoglobin level is low (8.6 g/dL), and his reticulocyte count is slightly elevated (0.5%), suggesting a chronic anemia. Given his chronic kidney disease, the most likely cause is decreased erythropoietin production due to renal insufficiency. Erythropoietin production is regulated through the JAK/STAT pathway. Therefore, the drug prescribed would likely target this pathway to stimulate erythropoiesis.

Answer: C",1522
114,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea, along with fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain. The lab results show metabolic acidosis with a low pH and bicarbonate level, and a respiratory compensation with elevated pCO2. 

- **Anxiety** is unlikely to cause such profound metabolic changes and specific lab values.
- **Diarrhea** can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, but typically does not cause such a marked metabolic acidosis without other contributing factors.
- **Metformin** can cause lactic acidosis, but the patient’s symptoms and lab values do not strongly suggest this, especially given the absence of other signs like hypoglycemia or a history of poor glycemic control.
- **Sleep apnea** can contribute to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia, leading to respiratory acidosis, which fits the lab findings of a low pH and elevated pCO2.

Answer: D",1896
115,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The drug inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head, which is crucial for the power stroke. Phosphate release is necessary for the myosin head to detach from actin, allowing the next cycle to begin. Without this detachment, the power stroke cannot occur.

Answer: D",1238
116,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has progressive weakness, cognitive delay, holosystolic murmur, and retinal calcifications. These findings are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The skin findings (not specified but often include angiofibromas) further support this diagnosis. The NF1 gene mutation causes neurofibromatosis type 1, the NF2 gene mutation causes neurofibromatosis type 2, and the VHL gene mutation causes von Hippel-Lindau disease, none of which match the clinical presentation.

Answer: C",1501
117,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. His past medical history includes diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and morbid obesity. The laboratory values show hypokalemia (normal K+), metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-), and hyperglycemia (high glucose). The key finding is the significant metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level, which suggests a renal cause such as renal tubular acidosis. 

- **Acyclovir** is associated with kidney problems but does not typically cause metabolic acidosis.
- **Atorvastatin** is used for lipid management and does not commonly cause metabolic acidosis.
- **Metformin** can cause lactic acidosis, but the patient's creatinine is elevated, suggesting renal impairment rather than lactic acidosis.
- **Metoprolol** is a beta-blocker and does not cause metabolic acidosis.

Given the patient's history of diabetic nephropathy and the presence of metabolic acidosis, the most likely etiology is a renal issue, specifically renal tubular acidosis, which can be caused by underlying chronic kidney disease like diabetic nephropathy.

Answer: C",2238
118,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history includes a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss, a 36-pack-year smoking history, and occupational exposure to steel dust. The pulmonary function test shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value, indicating obstructive lung disease. However, the total lung capacity and residual volume are elevated, which is not typical of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The DLCO is also reduced, suggesting involvement of the alveoli. Bronchiectasis typically presents with chronic cough and mucus production, which are not mentioned. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually presents with a dry cough and a more insidious onset of symptoms, without the obstructive pattern seen here. Asbestosis would present with a restrictive pattern rather than an obstructive one. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Answer: D",1777
119,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of a dry cough, fever, and chills, along with diffuse haziness on chest X-ray, suggest a possible respiratory infection. Given his occupation involving birds, the most likely cause is avian tuberculosis, which can present similarly. However, the PPD test is negative, making other causes more likely. Thoracocentesis is used to remove fluid from the pleural space, which is not indicated here since there is no mention of pleural effusion. Inhaled beclomethasone is used for asthma management, which does not address the underlying cause. Avoiding exposure to birds is crucial given his occupational risk, and isoniazid is typically used for treating Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections, which aligns with his symptoms and occupational risk.

Answer: C",2443
120,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient developed left-sided flank pain and oliguria after a laparoscopic hysterectomy, indicating possible renal involvement. The ligation of the artery could have compromised blood flow to the kidney. The artery of Sampson is not relevant as it is associated with the uterus and fallopian tubes. The superior vesical artery and uterine artery do not supply the kidneys. The ovarian artery, however, is a potential candidate as it supplies the ovary and can be ligated during hysterectomy procedures, potentially affecting renal perfusion if it is mistakenly ligated.

Answer: B",1560
121,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive weight loss, night sweats, recurrent low-grade fever, and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, which are classic symptoms of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Among the given options, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known to be associated with certain types of lymphomas, particularly those involving B cells. While Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is associated with T-cell lymphomas, Human herpesvirus-8 is linked to Kaposi's sarcoma and other cancers, and Human papillomavirus type 16 is associated with cervical cancer. Therefore, EBV is the most likely virus involved in this case.

Answer: A",2296
122,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient had a history of travel to Brazil and spent evenings outdoors without protection, suggesting potential mosquito exposure. The symptoms of fevers, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash are consistent with dengue fever. Additionally, the presence of fetal microcephaly in the ultrasound is concerning and could be associated with congenital infections. However, the IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative, ruling out toxoplasmosis. Dengue virus is known to cause a wide range of symptoms including those described, and it is transmitted by mosquitoes, fitting the travel history and outdoor activities. Rubella virus typically causes a different set of symptoms and is not associated with microcephaly in the fetus. Zika virus also causes similar symptoms and can lead to congenital abnormalities like microcephaly, but the patient's IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis being negative helps rule out other pathogens.

Answer: A",2078
123,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness, which are concerning for a potential stroke or other neurological condition. The laboratory findings show elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (APT) and thrombin time, indicating a coagulation disorder. The non-contrast CT of the head is not provided, but the clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a need to rule out a bleeding source in the brain.

- **Option A: Mixing study** - This is used to differentiate between congenital and acquired von Willebrand disease, which does not fit the current clinical scenario.
- **Option B: INR** - This measures the effect of warfarin and is not relevant given the current coagulation profile.
- **Option C: Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test** - This test assesses von Willebrand factor activity and is relevant given the abnormal coagulation times, making it a strong candidate.
- **Option D: Clot retraction study** - This evaluates plasmin activity and is not relevant to the current clinical presentation.

Answer: C",2336
124,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Congenital hypothyroidism due to inadequate maternal iodine intake can lead to various symptoms including hypotonia (reduced muscle tone) and macroglossia (large tongue). However, it does not typically cause diarrhea or umbilical hernia. Diarrhea is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues rather than thyroid dysfunction, and an umbilical hernia is a structural anomaly unrelated to thyroid function.

Answer: B",1786
125,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a positive PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration, indicating active tuberculosis infection. She does not have any symptoms of active TB, suggesting latent tuberculosis infection (LTB). Given her occupation as a nurse, there is a risk of exposure and transmission. Isoniazid is the standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection to prevent progression to active disease. Other options like rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are typically used for active TB, not LTB. Repeating the PPD in a week would not address the current positive result.

Answer: A",1741
126,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include disorientation, unequal pupil sizes (anisocoria), and a right-sided visual field defect, which suggest a mass effect or increased intracranial pressure. The CT scan would likely show an AVM if it were present. However, the clinical presentation is more consistent with uncal herniation, where the uncus of the temporal lobe is pushed under the tentorium cerebelli, leading to dilated non-reactive pupil (左侧瞳孔散大) and contralateral visual field loss. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well.

Answer: A",2679
127,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The context mentions that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in monoclonal plasma cells, and these cells are lysed without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. This process is characteristic of natural killer (NK) cells, which can directly kill abnormal cells through their CD226 receptor. Bone marrow-derived macrophages, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and band neutrophils do not have this specific function without prior activation.

Answer: C",1882
128,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulders and hips, along with difficulty climbing stairs and combing her hair. These symptoms are more consistent with a myopathy rather than a neuromuscular disorder. The family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in her maternal uncle suggests a genetic condition. The laboratory findings show mild elevations in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which are often elevated in muscular dystrophies. 

- Option A (Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy): This finding is more characteristic of inflammatory myopathies like dermatomyositis, not DMD.
- Option B (Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy): This finding is also more indicative of inflammatory myopathies, not DMD.
- Option C (Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies): This would suggest myasthenia gravis, not DMD.
- Option D (Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis): This directly confirms the diagnosis of DMD, given the family history and clinical presentation.

Answer: D",2098
129,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include sudden onset of blurry vision, double vision, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms are consistent with botulism, caused by botulinum toxin. The toxin affects the neuromuscular junction by preventing the release of acetylcholine, leading to flaccid paralysis. The fixed pupillary dilation and difficulty depressing both eyes are signs of oculomotor nerve involvement, further supporting botulism. Therefore, the pathogenesis involves decreased acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction.

Answer: A",2500
130,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increasing jaundice, pale stools, and elevated direct bilirubin, suggesting a blockage in bilirubin excretion. The high direct bilirubin level and elevated alkaline phosphatase are consistent with biliary obstruction. Galactosemia typically presents with cataracts, hepatomegaly, and hypoglycemia, which are not present here. Crigler-Najjar syndrome usually presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and not elevated direct bilirubin. Breast milk jaundice usually resolves on formula feeding and does not cause elevated alkaline phosphatase or direct bilirubin levels.

Answer: B",2190
131,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of total thyroidectomy and is experiencing symptoms of drug-induced QT prolongation, including nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and perioral numbness. The observation of hand spasms during blood pressure measurement further supports this. QT prolongation can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. The other ECG findings listed (peaked T waves, PR prolongation) are not directly related to the described symptoms and medications.

Answer: A",2149
132,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation and a history of mild constipation. These symptoms are more consistent with diverticulitis rather than irritable bowel syndrome, as the latter typically causes crampy pain without specific localization and does not correlate with defecation. Hypothyroidism and adenocarcinoma of the colon would present with more systemic symptoms and findings, such as weight loss or other constitutional symptoms, which are not mentioned. The laboratory findings show a high neutrophil count, which supports an infectious/inflammatory process like diverticulitis.

Answer: A",2519
133,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with erectile dysfunction and deep, burning buttock and hip pain relieved by rest, along with weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. These symptoms suggest vascular issues rather than a psychological cause. Aortoiliac atherosclerosis can cause both erectile dysfunction and claudication, but the specific relief of pain with rest and the presence of weak pulses point more towards vascular claudication. Spinal stenosis typically causes pain that improves with leaning forward and does not specifically affect erectile function. Anxiety can contribute to erectile dysfunction but does not explain the specific nature of the pain and vascular signs.

Answer: D",1958
134,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy and now presents with bone pain. This suggests a possible secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, the kidneys fail to produce enough calcitriol (active form of vitamin D), leading to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production to maintain calcium homeostasis. This results in increased PTH, decreased calcitriol, and often increased phosphate levels as the kidneys struggle to excrete it. The calcium levels can be either normal or slightly decreased depending on the severity of the CKD and the compensatory mechanisms.

Answer: A",1168
135,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The CD8-positive cells are likely mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes. When mixed with infected cells and crosslinked, the protein identified as binding to CD8 is most likely part of the class I MHC molecule, which presents endogenous peptides. Class I MHC molecules bind peptides derived from intracellular proteins (endogenous) and present them to cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, the protein identified is most likely binding endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) channel.

Answer: C",1249
136,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate, suggesting a possible association with acid reflux. An umbilical hernia and partially occluded coronary artery are less likely given the lack of exertional symptoms and a normal ECG. Intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction is not typically associated with chest pain. Therefore, the most likely cause is gastroesophageal junction incompetence leading to acid reflux.

Answer: C",1766
137,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral eyelid retraction, proptosis, and extraocular muscle enlargement, consistent with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Systemic corticosteroids can exacerbate hyperthyroidism and worsen Graves' ophthalmopathy by increasing intraocular pressure and edema. External orbital radiation, selenium supplementation, and radioactive iodine treatment are not known to transiently worsen these symptoms but rather are used to treat them.

Answer: C",2502
138,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with nocturnal enuresis who has never been dry for a week continuously. There is no history of daytime incontinence, urinary tract infections, or other urinary symptoms. The physical examination and laboratory findings are normal, ruling out structural abnormalities or infection. Nocturnal enuresis in this context is likely due to a functional or developmental issue rather than a structural one. An MRI of the spine is not indicated as there are no neurological symptoms or findings. Oxybutynin and imipramine are used for more severe cases or when there is evidence of bladder dysfunction, which is not present here. Reassuring the parents and using an enuresis alarm are appropriate first steps in managing this condition.

Answer: B",1760
139,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The atrophy is unilateral, affecting the neurons in one side of the spinal cord. This suggests a lesion in the posterior column-medial lemniscal system, which processes proprioception and fine touch. Therefore, the patient would have decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg.
Answer: D",1383
140,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, joint pain, headache, and neck stiffness, along with a rash, which are consistent with early signs of Lyme disease. The erythematous rash on her arm is also characteristic of erythema migrans, a hallmark of Lyme disease. Given these symptoms, the next best step is to start appropriate antibiotic therapy. Tetracycline is contraindicated in pregnant women due to potential adverse effects on fetal tooth development. Amoxicillin and gentamicin are not typically first-line treatments for Lyme disease. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is amoxicillin.

Answer: C",2088
141,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive weakness, amenorrhea, and elevated cortisol levels, indicative of Cushing's syndrome. The high 24-hour urinary cortisol and lack of suppression on the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test suggest an ACTH-dependent source, likely a pituitary adenoma. The inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is the gold standard for differentiating between pituitary and ectopic sources of ACTH in Cushing's syndrome.

Answer: D",3282
142,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Vincristine, an anticancer drug used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primarily works by inhibiting microtubule formation, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This mechanism is consistent with the patient's symptoms of progressive numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes, along with decreased sensation and diminished reflexes. The other options (inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization, creation of free radicals that unwind DNA, and incorporation of false pyrimidine analogues into DNA) are mechanisms associated with different chemotherapy drugs and do not align with the clinical presentation.

Answer: A",2211
143,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with painless hematuria, bladder wall thickening, and sessile masses with central necrosis. Biopsy shows moderately differentiated urothelial cells with abundant mitotic figures and nuclear atypia, indicative of transitional cell carcinoma. Among the options, aflatoxins are known to cause liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma but not directly associated with bladder cancer. Aromatic amines are linked to bladder cancer but are not specifically related to the given context. Ionizing radiation and radon exposure are known to increase the risk of bladder cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Given the histological findings, the most likely exposure is to ionizing radiation, which is a known risk factor for bladder cancer.

Answer: A",1680
144,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with short stature, delayed puberty, and no signs of breast or pubic hair development. These symptoms suggest a possible endocrine disorder such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Given the absence of pubic and axillary hair, there is no indication for pelvic ultrasound or measuring dehydroepiandrosterone levels, which are more relevant for assessing adrenal function. An MRI of the brain is not indicated unless there is suspicion of a central cause for the delayed puberty, which is less likely given the normal vital signs and no other neurological signs. Reassurance and follow-up are appropriate next steps while monitoring for any changes.

Answer: C",1685
145,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with facial and generalized edema, hypoproteinemia, and proteinuria, which are classic signs of nephrotic syndrome. The presence of proteinuria (4+), hypoalbuminemia (2.1 g/dL), and hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 270 mg/dL) further support this diagnosis. Nephrotic syndrome often involves subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy and deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence. Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely finding on renal biopsy would be subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy.

Answer: B",2230
146,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma, along with a solid skin lesion greater than 1 cm in diameter. These findings are more consistent with a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, specifically mycosis fungoides, which often presents with erythematous patches and plaques and can progress to larger lesions. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation:
- Vascular tumor containing spindle cells: Typically presents with vascular lesions.
- Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous–apocrine germ: More commonly associated with sebaceous gland tumors.
- Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes: More commonly associated with squamous cell carcinomas.

Answer: C",1803
147,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient reports difficulty relaxing, concentration issues, fatigue, and frequent shopping and stealing small items to relieve stress, followed by feelings of shame and guilt. These behaviors suggest a pattern of impulse control issues and emotional distress, which aligns with symptoms of an impulse control disorder, specifically kleptomania. Given her emotional and psychological distress, psychodynamic psychotherapy would be most appropriate to explore the underlying emotional conflicts and unconscious motivations driving her behavior.

Answer: C",2425
148,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with inappropriate behavior (foul language, grabbing people), word-finding difficulty, and inattention, which are consistent with frontotemporal dementia. Alzheimer's disease typically presents with memory loss as the earliest symptom, not behavioral changes. Vascular dementia usually involves multiple small strokes leading to cognitive decline, often with more pronounced motor deficits. Kluver-Bucy syndrome is characterized by hyperorality, hypersexuality, and other disinhibited behaviors, which do not match the patient's presentation.
Answer: B",2025
149,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus that affect the skin's integrity, leading to the formation of blisters and peeling skin. The primary defense against such bacterial toxins involves antibodies that neutralize them. Among the immunoglobulins, IgG is the most abundant and plays a crucial role in neutralizing toxins and fighting bacterial infections. IgD, IgA, and IgM have different roles but are not primarily involved in neutralizing bacterial toxins.

Answer: A",2193
150,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of a respiratory infection (dry cough, shortness of breath, low-grade fever) and gastrointestinal symptoms (watery diarrhea). The chest x-ray shows patchy infiltrates, indicating a possible pneumonia. Given the wide range of potential pathogens, a broad-spectrum antibiotic is needed. 

- **Levofloxacin** (A): Broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone suitable for various bacterial infections, including pneumonia and gastrointestinal infections.
- **Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole** (B): Effective against many bacteria and some protozoal infections, but not typically first-line for community-acquired pneumonia.
- **Amoxicillin** (C): Narrower spectrum compared to levofloxacin, primarily effective against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.
- **Rifampin** (D): Primarily used for tuberculosis and certain resistant bacterial infections, not indicated here.

Given the need for a broad-spectrum agent, **Levofloxacin** is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: A",2142
151,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The presence of an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with anechoic spaces but no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid suggests a molar pregnancy or other gestational trophoblastic disease. The enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts are characteristic of theca lutein cysts, which form due to excessive production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by a molar pregnancy or other gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. 

Answer: D",1849
152,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a viral infection with specific characteristics (helical capsid and segmented genome), suggesting an influenza virus. Her son, who lives with the same family and has not developed symptoms despite exposure, is likely protected due to prior infection or vaccination. Among the given options, only a homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene can provide intrinsic protection against certain viruses, including those that use CCR5 as a co-receptor, such as HIV. However, since the virus here is influenza, the most relevant factor would be prior exposure or immunity rather than a genetic mutation. 

Answer: D",1870
153,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of a previous suicide attempt, which is a strong predictor of future attempts. While psychosis and sleep disorders are significant, the history of a deliberate overdose indicates a higher risk. Age and lack of firearm at home are less directly linked to immediate suicide risk compared to prior attempts.
Answer: A",2019
154,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a generalized rash, severe itching, fever, headache, and muscle pain. These symptoms are consistent with chickenpox, which is characterized by a rash that includes macules, papules, crusted lesions, and fluid-filled vesicles. The rash typically starts on the face, trunk, and then spreads to the extremities. Measles would present with a more specific rash starting on the face and progressing to the rest of the body, but without the fluid-filled vesicles seen here. Urushiol-induced dermatitis would cause a more localized reaction and is less likely given the generalized nature of the rash. Rubella typically presents with a mild rash and is less severe than the described symptoms. 

Answer: C",1950
155,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include delusions, agitation, hyperreflexia, dilated pupils, and a positive urine toxicology for ethyl glucuronide (indicating alcohol use). These symptoms are more consistent with a toxic effect rather than a brief psychotic episode or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Anticholinergic toxicity can cause confusion, agitation, and autonomic instability, but the presence of delusions and a positive alcohol screen makes synthetic cathinone intoxication more likely given the context of recent partying and the patient's history of alcohol use.

Answer: D",2797
156,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of neck stiffness, inability to move the neck, and muscle rigidity are consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can be caused by antipsychotic medications. The patient's history of schizophrenia and recent increase in antipsychotic medication use supports this diagnosis. Benztropine is commonly used to manage NMS due to its anticholinergic properties, which help alleviate the muscle rigidity and stiffness associated with NMS. Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic but is less commonly used for NMS compared to benztropine. Levodopa is used for Parkinson's disease and is not indicated here. Dantrolene relaxes skeletal muscles but is not the first-line treatment for NMS.

Answer: B",2287
157,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has hepatosplenomegaly and a milky appearance of the blood sample with a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration, indicating the presence of chylomicrons. This suggests a lipoprotein disorder, specifically a defect in lipoprotein metabolism. The mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, which can lead to acute pancreatitis due to elevated triglyceride levels. Other conditions like myocardial infarction, corneal arcus, and cerebrovascular accident are not directly linked to the described symptoms and genetic mutation.

Answer: A",1348
158,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping, which are signs of hypocalcemia. The serum magnesium level is low (1.7 mEq/L), suggesting a potential cause of hypocalcemia. Calcium gluconate is the most appropriate initial treatment for hypocalcemia. Rehydration therapy and imaging are not indicated based on the current information. Vitamin D supplementation would be more appropriate if there were evidence of vitamin D deficiency, but given the normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, it is not the most urgent intervention.

Answer: C",3188
159,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst, along with frequent episodes of constipation since birth. These symptoms suggest a renal tubular disorder affecting electrolyte balance. The low serum potassium (3.2 mEq/L) and elevated plasma renin activity (10 ng/mL/hr) and aldosterone concentration (20 ng/dL) are consistent with Bartter syndrome. Renal artery stenosis typically causes hypertension and does not present with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Pheochromocytoma would present with hypertension and tachycardia, not the electrolyte abnormalities seen here. Gitelman syndrome also causes hypokalemia but usually presents later in childhood and with more pronounced hypomagnesemia.

Answer: B",2296
160,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has sickle-cell disease, which predisposes to infections due to splenic dysfunction. The spleen plays a crucial role in filtering out encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The partial splenectomy further increases this risk. The picture shows a slide from the resected spleen, indicating its removal. Therefore, the patient's splenic function is compromised, making them more susceptible to these infections.

Answer: B",3249
161,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dry mouth and dry eyes, tender parotid glands, and dry mucous membranes, along with high titers of serum anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies. These symptoms and lab findings are characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects exocrine glands. While the patient has a family history of systemic lupus erythematosus, which is associated with Sjögren's syndrome, the primary diagnosis here is Sjögren's syndrome. Among the given options, the patient is most at risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a common complication of Sjögren's syndrome.

Answer: B",1881
162,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fatigue, progressive cough with hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and dark urine. These symptoms suggest a systemic disease affecting the lungs and kidneys. Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) serologies being positive is a key diagnostic clue for Goodpasture syndrome, which is characterized by linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence. This specific feature distinguishes it from other conditions like granulomatous inflammation (seen in sarcoidosis) or cryoglobulinemia (associated with hepatitis C infection). The longitudinal splitting and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane are more characteristic of other kidney diseases such as lupus nephritis.

Answer: C",2070
163,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has HIV, progressive neurological symptoms, and positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs, indicating meningitis. The CSF culture grows a pathogen that can be cultured on Sabouraud agar, suggesting a fungal infection. Among the options, only a positive PCR for HSV-2 DNA (option B) is not typically associated with fungal infections. Tachyzoites (option C) are associated with Toxoplasmosis, which is often diagnosed by adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels. A positive latex agglutination test (option A) is used for syphilis, not fungal infections. Increased ADA concentration (option D) is more indicative of Toxoplasmosis in HIV patients.

Answer: D",1847
164,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a burning pain in the upper right back and chest, along with a rash covering multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions. These symptoms are characteristic of herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in dorsal root ganglia. The rash pattern and distribution are consistent with shingles, particularly given the patient's volunteer work with animals, which could expose her to the virus. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation: IgA deposits are seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, bacterial infections typically present with purulent lesions, and infestations with blood-sucking parasites usually cause pruritus and papular lesions rather than a specific dermatomal distribution.

Answer: A",1976
165,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The new screening test detects the cancer 2 years before the onset of clinical symptoms, which means that patients in the screened group will have a longer period of asymptomatic detection. This could lead to lead-time bias, where the apparent improvement in survival is due to earlier detection rather than a true improvement in outcomes. To prevent this bias, it is important to use mortality rates instead of survival rates in the analysis, as survival rates can be inflated by the lead-time effect.

Answer: B",2215
166,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of working in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years suggests exposure to silica dust, which is a key risk factor for silicosis. The presence of interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate on chest radiograph aligns with the characteristic findings of silicosis. Additionally, the eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies is also commonly seen in silicosis. Berylliosis typically presents with chronic lung disease and is less likely to present with such specific radiographic findings. Asbestosis and talcosis are less likely given the specific occupational exposure to silica and the characteristic imaging findings.

Answer: B",2021
167,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's recent loss and shock from the death of her husband suggest a psychological trigger for her symptoms. The presence of an S3 heart sound and rales in the lungs indicate heart failure or fluid overload. The enlarged left ventricle and left atrium seen on echocardiography are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which often presents with these findings without significant ECG changes or other structural heart disease. Atrial fibrillation would typically show irregularly irregular rhythms on ECG and constrictive pericarditis would present with a characteristic pericardial rub and Kussmaul's sign. Restrictive cardiomyopathy, while associated with left ventricular enlargement, is less commonly associated with acute onset and the absence of significant ECG changes makes it less likely.

Answer: C",1990
168,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with unconsciousness, bloody vomit, and black tarry stool (melena), indicating significant gastrointestinal bleeding. The presence of food particles and the smell of alcohol suggests recent ingestion. An upper GI endoscopy is the most appropriate next step to identify the source of bleeding, such as a peptic ulcer or other lesions. Colonoscopy is less urgent given the acute upper GI bleeding, and proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics are not indicated without evidence of peptic ulcer disease or H. pylori infection. Surgery is typically reserved for severe cases where endoscopic treatment fails.

Answer: B",1917
169,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and a recent sore throat. These symptoms suggest a possible post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is characterized by immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. The presence of an elevated antistreptolysin O titer supports a streptococcal infection preceding the renal symptoms. Among the given options, antigen-antibody complexes (C) are the most relevant mechanism for immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis.

Answer: C",1458
170,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, hypotension, bradypnea, and hypoxemia. These findings suggest a severe condition such as drug overdose or alcohol intoxication. Ataxia, conjunctival injection, miosis, and nystagmus are all potential findings in various conditions, but given the context of altered mental status and hypotension, ataxia is a more specific neurological sign indicating cerebellar dysfunction, which could be due to toxic effects from substances like alcohol or other drugs.

Answer: A",1952
171,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a male fetus with IUGR, microcephaly, and a VSD. Microcephaly suggests a small head size, which is often associated with genetic syndromes like Trisomy 13 or 18. The convex-rounded feet and clenched fists with overlapping fingers are characteristic of Trisomy 18. Cleft palate is more commonly associated with Trisomy 13 rather than Trisomy 18. Epicanthal folds are seen in Down syndrome, and prominent occiput is not typically associated with these findings. Therefore, the most likely additional finding is cleft palate.

Answer: A",2222
172,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient is showing signs of delirium, including hallucinations (talking to someone who isn't there), agitation, and restlessness. These symptoms suggest a need for rapid sedation to prevent harm to the patient or others. Diphenhydramine is primarily used for sedation but can paradoxically cause agitation in some individuals. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that effectively sedates and reduces agitation. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for more severe cases of delirium. Physical restraints should be a last resort. Given the patient's behavior, lorazepam is the most appropriate initial management.

Answer: B",2308
173,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: Metyrapone is a drug used to stimulate the adrenal cortex to assess its function. It inhibits the enzyme 11-beta hydroxylase, leading to a decrease in cortisol production. Since the metyrapone stimulation test ruled out adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands are functioning normally and should produce adequate cortisol in response to ACTH. Therefore, we would expect an increase in serum cortisol levels.

Answer: D",1930
174,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The study compares survival times between patients diagnosed through asymptomatic screening MRI and those diagnosed based on symptoms. The key issue here is that earlier diagnosis through screening does not necessarily correlate with a longer actual survival time but rather with a longer period from diagnosis to the usual clinical presentation of symptoms. This aligns with the definition of lead-time bias, where the apparent improvement in survival is due to earlier detection rather than a genuine increase in longevity.

Answer: D",2215
175,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has severe chest pain, confusion, hypotension, jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on percussion on the left side. These findings suggest a tension pneumothorax, which requires immediate intervention to prevent further respiratory compromise and potential cardiac tamponade. A CT scan of the chest would take too long and bronchoscopy is not indicated for suspected tension pneumothorax. An emergency thoracotomy is too aggressive for a suspected tension pneumothorax. Needle decompression is the most appropriate next step to relieve the tension pneumothorax immediately.

Answer: D",2480
176,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: Specificity is calculated as the number of true negatives (correctly identified negative cases) divided by the total number of actual negatives (both true negatives and false positives). Here, the true negatives are 580 (600 - 20), and the total number of actual negatives is 620 (600 - 20 + 600).

Answer: A",1222
177,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's history includes bilateral wrist and knee pain for 10 years, morning stiffness lasting 50 minutes, and non-tender nodules on distal interphalangeal joints. These findings are more consistent with gout, which often presents with chronic joint pain and tophi formation. Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects the spine and does not typically cause wrist pain. Osteoarthritis can cause joint pain and stiffness but usually does not present with tophi. Fibromyalgia involves widespread pain and specific tender points but does not typically cause tophi or crystal deposits in joints.
Answer: B",2029
178,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient experienced left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation, indicating a possible nerve root compression or spinal cord injury at the C5 level. A T2-weighted MRI showing a left C5 hemicord lesion supports this. Spastic paralysis is a common finding in upper motor neuron lesions, which would be consistent with a spinal cord injury. Right-sided Horner's syndrome, contralateral corticospinal tract involvement, and right-sided analgesia are less likely given the localized lesion at C5.

Answer: A",1881
179,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain, burning sensation on urination, and increased urinary frequency. These symptoms are more consistent with a urinary tract infection or sexually transmitted infection rather than a testicular tumor or varicocele. The absence of urethral discharge and the presence of increased blood flow to the right testicle on ultrasound suggest inflammation rather than a mass. The Gram stain showing polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms is consistent with a non-specific inflammatory response, which can occur with both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections. However, the lack of specific organisms on Gram stain and the typical asymptomatic nature of Chlamydia make it the more likely cause given the symptoms and the young age of the patient.

Answer: C",1903
180,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with recurrent bleeding (nosebleeds, petechiae, ecchymosis) and a history of multiple small bruises. The platelet count is elevated, and the platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease and Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. Scurvy typically presents with more generalized symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and poor wound healing, which are not prominent in this case. Bernard-Soulier disease is characterized by large platelets and a defect in the GPIb-IX-V complex, which aligns with the findings here.
Answer: C",2422
181,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dysuria and increased urinary frequency, along with cloudy and red urine. These symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The virus causing these symptoms should be associated with urinary tract infections. Among the given options, the virus with non-enveloped, linear, single-stranded RNA is known to commonly cause UTIs, such as Enterovirus.

Answer: B",1762
182,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a left breast lump, cryptorchidism, and a family history of breast fibroadenoma. The testes are small and the breast mass is firm and tender. Klinefelter syndrome is less likely given the absence of other typical symptoms like infertility or small testicles. Glandular tissue enlargement and lipomastia are less likely given the firmness and tenderness of the mass. Testicular cancer is possible but less likely without other concerning features like a rapidly growing mass or other symptoms. The most likely diagnosis is glandular tissue enlargement (gynecomastia) secondary to cryptorchidism and hormonal imbalances.

Answer: B",2115
183,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and an inherited condition. This suggests a genetic predisposition to thrombosis. Elevated serum homocysteine can lead to hypercoagulability but is not typically associated with recurrent VTE without other risk factors. Thrombin inhibitor deficiency and auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids are less commonly associated with isolated VTE. Resistance to clotting factor degradation is a hallmark of the antithrombin deficiency, which is a common inherited cause of thrombophilia. Given the recurrent nature of the thrombi and the inherited condition, the most likely pathophysiology is resistance to clotting factor degradation.

Answer: D",2595
184,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with memory lapses, difficulty performing daily activities, and a blunted affect, which are consistent with Alzheimer's disease. The most appropriate treatment for Alzheimer's disease is memantine, which is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Fluoxetine is used for depression and anxiety but not specifically for Alzheimer's disease. Aspirin is used for preventing blood clots and is not indicated for Alzheimer's disease. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is used for hydrocephalus, which is not indicated here. 

Answer: D",2309
185,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has been diagnosed with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that typically requires aggressive treatment such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. Refusing this treatment significantly increases the risk of the tumor becoming unresectable and negatively impacts prognosis. While supportive care can provide comfort, it is not sufficient for managing this condition. Allowing the parents to take two weeks to think (Option C) or referring to another oncologist (Option B) does not address the urgent need for treatment. Seeking a court order (Option D) is an extreme measure and not the first step. 

Answer: A",1772
186,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The ribosome does not have the capability to recognize and remove mischarged tRNAs on its own. Proteasomes degrade proteins, not tRNAs. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for charging tRNAs correctly, but it does not remove mischarged tRNAs from the ribosome. Therefore, the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated into the growing peptide despite being mischarged.

Answer: B",1593
187,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient requires a medication that can reduce his opioid need by interacting with the NMDA receptor. Fentanyl primarily acts as an opioid agonist and does not interact with NMDA receptors. Propofol is used for anesthesia and sedation but does not affect NMDA receptors. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine and does not interact with NMDA receptors. Ketamine is known to block NMDA receptors, thereby reducing the need for opioids in managing severe pain. Therefore, ketamine is the most likely recommended agent.

Answer: B",1672
188,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include shoulder pain worsening when sleeping on the left side, tenderness localized to the greater tuberosity and biceps tendon, limited range of motion, and X-ray findings of acromiohumeral space narrowing, acromial spurring, and sclerosis. These findings are more consistent with rotator cuff injury rather than trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid factor being positive could suggest rheumatoid arthritis, but the localized tenderness and specific X-ray findings are more indicative of rotator cuff pathology. 

Answer: D",2394
189,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's history of irregular menses, enlarged cheeks, calluses on the hands, and recent binge eating suggests a possible diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or another hormonal disorder. However, the context of a malar rash, which is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is not supported by the given information. Enlarged cheeks and calluses could be related to her binge eating behavior, but they are not specific findings for a malar rash. Elevated blood glucose levels and erosion of tooth enamel are not typically associated with the described symptoms. Therefore, the most likely additional finding is not a malar rash.

Answer: B",1548
190,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include episodic chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness, and heavy sweating, which are consistent with panic attacks. The patient also reports increasing anxiety about future attacks and avoiding situations where they might occur, indicating a diagnosis of panic disorder. 

- Citalopram is an SSRI used for anxiety disorders but is not typically the first-line treatment for panic disorder.
- Lithium is primarily used for bipolar disorder and not indicated for panic disorder.
- Propranolol is a beta-blocker commonly used to treat the physical symptoms of panic attacks, such as rapid heartbeat and tremors, making it a good option for long-term management.
- Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia but not for panic disorder.

Answer: C",2048
191,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The stillborn infant has multiple congenital anomalies including a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet, along with the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. These findings suggest a severe neural tube defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida. Chromosome 18 trisomy (Edwards syndrome) can also present with multiple congenital anomalies but typically includes additional features like heart defects and growth restriction, which are not strongly indicated here. Maternal oligohydramnios and intrauterine alcohol exposure can cause specific anomalies but do not explain the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Therefore, the most likely cause is a chromosomal abnormality affecting neural development.

Answer: D",1360
192,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The difference observed between the two strata (patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and those above 200/mm3) indicates that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk varies depending on the CD4+ cell count. This suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is not consistent across different levels of CD4+ cell count, which is a hallmark of effect modification.
Answer: D",2120
193,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Th1 cells are associated with the adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They secrete IFN-gamma, which activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide (NO) and stimulate phagosome-lysosome fusion. This process enhances the ability of macrophages to kill the pathogen. Histamine is not typically secreted by Th1 cells and is more related to allergic reactions and gut regulation. IL-4 is a Th2 cytokine and does not play a primary role in the Th1 response against intracellular pathogens. TNF-alpha can contribute to inflammation but is not specifically responsible for the activation of macrophages in this context.

Answer: C",1588
194,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with abdominal pain, constipation, irritability, and pale conjunctivae. The peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling, which are characteristic of sideroblastic anemia. This condition is associated with impaired heme synthesis, specifically at the level of ferrochelatase, which converts ferrous iron to ferric iron in the final step of heme synthesis. The other options involve earlier steps in the porphyrin pathway and do not directly explain the clinical presentation.

Answer: A",1983
195,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The study involved retrospective surveys about folic acid consumption before pregnancy. Mothers had to recall their dietary habits from the past, which can introduce recall bias. The high response rate does not eliminate the possibility of inaccurate recall due to the passage of time. Other biases like interviewer bias, latency period, and survival bias do not directly relate to the recall of past behaviors.

Answer: C",1704
196,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Apixaban is eliminated because it is primarily eliminated via the liver and not the kidneys, and its half-life is longer than 4 hours. Enoxaparin is given by injection and is eliminated more rapidly. Fondaparinux is a factor Xa inhibitor with a very short half-life, typically less than 4 hours. Warfarin is primarily eliminated via the liver with a half-life of about 20-30 hours, making it consistent with the observed elimination rate of 0.5 mg every 4 hours.

Answer: A",1426
197,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of rising BUN and creatinine levels, indicating progressive kidney dysfunction. The current BUN is significantly higher than the previous visit (59 mg/dL vs. 45 mg/dL), and the creatinine has also increased from 2.0 mg/dL to 2.3 mg/dL. This suggests chronic rather than acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient does not have any urinary symptoms or signs of obstruction, ruling out obstructive uropathy. While the patient could potentially have renal cell carcinoma, the presentation and lab values are more consistent with chronic kidney disease. 

Answer: B",2223
198,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient is trying to conceive and has a history of prior abdominal surgery and endocrine abnormalities. The treatment is administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle, suggesting a hormonal intervention like clomiphene citrate, which is used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS or other ovulatory disorders. Clomiphene works by stimulating the ovaries to release eggs. If given differently, it could treat polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Answer: C",1481
199,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient has recurrent urinary tract infections, bilateral renal pelvis dilation, and retrograde flow into the ureters. These findings suggest vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Histologically, VUR is often associated with thickened glomerular capillary loops due to chronic inflammation and hyperperfusion. The other options are less specific to VUR:
- Glomerular crescents with macrophages are more indicative of acute glomerulonephritis.
- Mesangial proliferation can occur in various glomerular diseases.
- Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy is seen in chronic kidney disease.

Answer: D",1407
200,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient was found near antifreeze, suggesting methanol exposure. Methanol is metabolized to formic acid, which can cause renal tubular damage leading to proteinuria and casts in the urine. Hyaline casts are commonly associated with renal tubular injury. There is no indication of ketonuria or crystal formation specific to urate or calcium oxalate in this context.

Answer: B",2537
201,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has severe acne vulgaris, which is responsive to hormonal treatments like combined oral contraceptive pills. These medications reduce sebum production and improve acne by modulating hormone levels. Hypertension and ovarian cancer are not directly related to acne treatment with oral contraceptives. Cervical cancer is not influenced by hormonal acne treatments. Breast cancer is a potential side effect of long-term oral contraceptive use but is not the primary benefit of the medication in this context.

Answer: B",1547
202,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a fixed, immobile, and non-tender thyroid nodule, which suggests a more aggressive form of thyroid cancer, such as anaplastic thyroid carcinoma or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. These types of cancers commonly metastasize to cervical lymph nodes. The trachea, inferior thyroid arteries, and thyrohyoid muscle are less likely to be the initial metastatic sites given the clinical presentation and the nature of the tumor. 

Answer: B",1962
203,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe headaches, fever, and swelling of the right eyelid, along with lymphadenopathy and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg. These symptoms suggest a possible infectious process, possibly a vasculitis or an infection. Given the recent travel history to multiple countries, the most likely diagnosis is a parasitic infection such as leishmaniasis, which can present with these symptoms. Ivermectin is commonly used to treat various parasitic infections, including those caused by Leishmania species. Benznidazole and sodium stibogluconate are also used for leishmaniasis but are less commonly used compared to ivermectin. Mebendazole is primarily used for intestinal worm infections and does not treat leishmaniasis.

Answer: B",1569
204,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The fusion of the poles of the kidneys in Turner's syndrome is due to the failure of the kidneys to ascend normally during embryonic development. This process is typically not affected by the celiac artery, splenic artery, or inferior mesenteric artery. However, the superior mesenteric artery can interfere with renal ascent if it crosses over the upper pole of the developing kidney. Therefore, the superior mesenteric artery is the structure that could prevent normal renal ascension.

Answer: A",1362
205,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has suffered a Grade V splenic laceration and had an emergent splenectomy. The spleen plays a crucial role in producing antibodies and filtering bacteria from the bloodstream. After splenectomy, patients are at increased risk for infections caused by encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis. Tetanus vaccination is important but not specifically related to splenectomy. Hepatitis B vaccine is not typically recommended post-splenectomy unless there is a specific indication. Therefore, the vaccines that should be administered are H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae.

Answer: B",2105
206,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The LOD score is used to determine the likelihood of two genetic markers being linked. A higher LOD score indicates a higher probability of linkage. The question asks for a high probability of linkage, which corresponds to a LOD score greater than 3.

Answer: C",1497
207,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: CIN I typically represents a mild dysplasia and is often self-resolving. Close observation with regular screening is generally recommended for low-grade lesions like CIN I. Cryotherapy and LEEP are more commonly used for higher-grade lesions (CIN II-III). Hysterectomy is an extreme measure and not indicated for such a low-grade lesion in a young, sexually active woman. Therefore, close observation with regular screening is the most appropriate initial management.

Answer: A",1774
208,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Darunavir is a nonpeptidic inhibitor of HIV-1 protease that strongly binds to the protease enzyme. Since DN501 has the same mechanism of action, it also targets the protease enzyme. This inhibition prevents the cleavage of viral polyproteins necessary for viral maturation and replication. None of the other options (viral transcription, assembly, entry, or T-cell binding) are directly inhibited by protease inhibitors. Therefore, DN501 works by inhibiting viral protease activity.

Answer: B",1856
209,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a painless lesion on the lower lip, which is a characteristic feature of actinic keratosis, a precancerous lesion caused by chronic sun exposure. Aphthous stomatitis typically presents as painful ulcers, not painless ones. Squamous cell carcinoma usually presents as a persistent, non-healing ulcer with irregular borders and may be painful. Traumatic ulcers are caused by physical injury and would likely have a history of trauma. Given the patient's history of working outdoors and smoking, actinic keratosis is the most likely diagnosis.
Answer: C",1579
210,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which is involved in promoting the transition from G1 to S phase. Since the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is inhibited by phosphorylation, allowing the cell cycle to progress, the administration of drug X would likely push the cells into the S phase rather than arresting them in G1 or any other phase.

Answer: C",1050
211,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's presentation includes painless neck swelling, intermittent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, consistent with lymphoma. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level further supports this. The histopathologic analysis of the lymph node biopsy would confirm the diagnosis. Among the given options, the TRAP test is specific for histiocytes and is used to diagnose histiocytic disorders like histiocytic lymphoma. Given the context, the TRAP test is the most relevant diagnostic step.

Answer: D",2800
212,Treatment,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The study involved only 14 patients, which is a very small sample size. This low number of patients makes it difficult to generalize the findings to a larger population. Additionally, the editor suggested submitting the study as a case series, indicating that the study did not meet the criteria for a cohort study due to its small sample size and lack of representativeness.

Answer: B",1691
213,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a change in mental status, fever, and right upper quadrant discomfort with a palpable mass. An ultrasound shows pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without gallstones. These findings are consistent with cholecystitis. Given the absence of gallstones, acalculous cholecystitis (option A) is the most likely diagnosis. Calculous cholecystitis (option B) would be expected to show gallstones on imaging. Choledocholithiasis (option C) involves stones in the common bile duct, which is not indicated by the ultrasound findings. Emphysematous cholecystitis (option D) involves gas within the gallbladder wall, which is not present here.

Answer: A",2158
214,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL indicates severe hypoglycemia, which is not consistent with hypothyroidism (option C) or somatization disorder (option D). An insulinoma (option A) would typically present with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, but the patient reports this is her first episode. Additionally, the patient's Hgb A1c of 5.1% is within the normal range, suggesting no underlying diabetes. The patient's history of a difficult divorce and the deliberate feigning of symptoms align with a factitious disorder (option B).

Answer: B",2215
215,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and nocturia suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There is no evidence of infection or other pathology, and the physical examination is unremarkable. Given the patient's age and symptoms, a digital rectal examination (DRE) is not indicated as the primary next step since there are no palpable masses or tenderness. Urinalysis and serum creatinine can help rule out kidney disease but are not the first-line investigation for BPH. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is useful for evaluating for prostate cancer, but given the absence of risk factors and the more likely diagnosis of BPH, it is not the best initial step. Reassurance and further observation are appropriate given the patient's symptoms and the lack of concerning findings.

Answer: B",1842
216,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with episodes of reddish urine, bilateral flank pain, and hematuria, along with hypertension and costovertebral tenderness. The urine shows proteinuria and hematuria without casts or dysmorphic RBCs. These findings suggest a condition affecting the renal tubules rather than glomeruli or infection. Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels would typically present with more specific symptoms like acute kidney injury or acute onset of symptoms. Tubular lumen obstruction by protein casts would be more indicative of conditions like amyloidosis or multiple myeloma, which are not suggested by the clinical context. Therefore, the most likely cause is renal papillary ischemia due to chronic use of aspirin.

Answer: C",1901
217,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pain, and an embryo without fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound, indicating a missed abortion. The dilated cervical os supports this diagnosis. Misoprostol and methotrexate are used for medical management of threatened abortion or molar pregnancy, not for missed abortion. Complete bed rest is not a standard treatment for missed abortion. Dilation and curettage (D&C) is the appropriate procedure to remove the remaining tissue and prevent complications such as infection or heavy bleeding.

Answer: C",1857
218,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient develops pruritic wheals due to a type I hypersensitivity reaction, indicating an immediate allergic response. Histamine release typically causes vasodilation and increased permeability in the superficial layers of the skin. The stratum corneum and stratum granulosum are the outermost layers and do not directly respond to histamine release. The stratum basale is the deepest layer of the epidermis and does not show visible changes in wheal formation. The dermis, while involved in the inflammatory response, does not show the characteristic wheals directly. Therefore, the layer most likely to show histologic changes is the stratum corneum, as it is the first layer affected by the increased permeability and vasodilation.

Answer: A",1237
219,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with recurrent pneumonia, thick purulent cough, fever, and foul-smelling stools. These symptoms suggest an underlying immunodeficiency or chronic respiratory issue. The presence of a small nasal polyp further indicates a chronic inflammatory process. 

- Option A (Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator) is too specific and not commonly associated with recurrent pneumonia and gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Option B (Inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine) relates to amino acid metabolism disorders, which do not typically present with recurrent pneumonia and gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Option D (Deficiency in lymphocytic activity) could explain recurrent infections but does not account for the gastrointestinal symptoms and nasal polyps.
- Option C (Dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia) can lead to chronic respiratory issues and recurrent infections but does not explain the gastrointestinal symptoms.

Answer: C",2189
220,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include breathlessness, exercise intolerance, and a dry cough, along with inspiratory crackles on physical examination. These findings suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or another obstructive lung condition. The presence of inspiratory crackles and the need for rest while walking are consistent with airflow obstruction. The echocardiogram showing a normal ejection fraction and the chest radiograph (not shown here) would help rule out other causes like heart failure. Spirometry in COPD typically shows a decreased FEV1 and FVC with a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio, indicating obstructive lung disease.

Answer: B",2365
221,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The mother has HIV and received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, but her viral load is low (678 copies/mL). The newborn's Apgar scores are within normal limits, and there are no physical abnormalities noted. Given these circumstances, the most appropriate next step is to monitor the infant rather than immediately administering medication or performing diagnostic tests.

Answer: D",1751
222,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath on exertion, gross ascites, visible engorged periumbilical veins, and bilateral pitting edema. These findings suggest liver dysfunction, specifically portal hypertension, which can be caused by conditions like cirrhosis. The most common anti-diabetic medication associated with liver toxicity and portal hypertension is metformin. Metformin works by closing ATP-sensitive K-channels in the pancreatic beta-cell, thereby increasing insulin sensitivity. This mechanism does not directly cause liver dysfunction. Therefore, the other options can be eliminated as they do not relate to liver toxicity.

Answer: B",3027
223,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of episodic pelvic pain radiating to the back and thighs, occurring a few hours before menstruation and lasting for 2 days, are characteristic of dysmenorrhea. This condition is commonly caused by endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandins. The other options are less likely: an ascending infection would typically present with fever and more systemic symptoms; a fluid-filled sac within the ovary (ovarian cyst) would not be associated with pain specifically before menstruation; and a hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor would not be related to the timing of the pain relative to menstruation.

Answer: A",1860
224,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include acute agitation, photophobia, dysphagia, and a history of spelunking in Mexico. These symptoms suggest involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). The autopsy findings indicate a viral infection spreading to the CNS. 

- Option A (Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges) is possible but less specific for a spelunking-related infection.
- Option B (Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons) is unlikely as the symptoms do not suggest peripheral nerve involvement.
- Option C (Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia) is less likely given the acute onset and systemic symptoms.
- Option D (Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) fits well with the acute CNS involvement and the reported symptoms affecting multiple systems.

Answer: D",2128
225,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has hypopigmented skin and an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection causing patchy hypopigmentation, not an absence of melanocytes. Melanoma involves abnormal melanocytes and does not result in their absence. Vitiligo involves the loss of melanocytes but does not completely remove them. Albinism is characterized by the congenital absence of melanin, matching the patient's description. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is albinism.

Answer: B",1396
226,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient's initial presentation of high WBC count, normocytic lymphocytes, and subsequent confirmation through bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry suggests a high-grade lymphoma, such as Burkitt lymphoma. The development of lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and splenomegaly with pain indicates advanced disease. Burkitt lymphoma typically presents with high-grade tumors that rapidly progress, fitting the patient's clinical course. Treatment for Burkitt lymphoma involves combination chemotherapy regimens, not targeted therapies like imatinib or drugs targeting specific chromosomal translocations. Bleomycin and vincristine are commonly used in Burkitt lymphoma treatment protocols. Fludarabine is used in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and some lymphomas but is not standard for Burkitt lymphoma.

Answer: D",2145
227,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a headache, nausea, and decreased urination, along with metabolic acidosis (low HCO3-). The drug causing these symptoms should be associated with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. 

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Causes no significant metabolic acidosis or hypokalemia.
- **Eplerenone**: An aldosterone antagonist, does not cause metabolic acidosis or hypokalemia.
- **Amphotericin B**: Primarily causes fever, chills, and headaches but not metabolic acidosis or hypokalemia.
- **Amiloride**: Known to cause hypokalemia and can lead to metabolic acidosis due to its diuretic effect and potential to cause renal tubular acidosis.

Answer: D",1786
228,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient recently returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, where dengue fever and hepatitis A are endemic. The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are consistent with dengue fever. Chikungunya typically presents with more severe joint pain but without the characteristic rash seen here. Epstein-Barr virus usually causes infectious mononucleosis with pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy, not the specific symptoms described. Hepatitis A would present with jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels, which are not present in this case.

Answer: B",3252
229,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has persistent hypotension despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for E. coli bacteremia. Her leukocyte count has decreased but remains elevated, indicating ongoing infection. Costovertebral tenderness suggests possible pyelonephritis, which could explain the persistent hypotension. The repeat blood cultures are negative, and there are no signs of thyroid dysfunction. Given the context, the most appropriate treatment is to continue treating the underlying illness (sepsis and potential pyelonephritis).

Answer: D",2790
230,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse, indicating a narrowing or obstruction in the aorta between the upper and lower body. This is consistent with coarctation of the aorta. The loud S1, loud S2, and S4 suggest volume overload on the left side of the heart. The presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area is also indicative of coarctation of the aorta. Notching of the ribs on chest X-ray can be seen in coarctation of the aorta due to hypertension. Pulmonic stenosis, aortic stenosis, and transposition of the great vessels do not present with these specific findings.

Answer: B",1783
231,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of septic arthritis after a total knee arthroplasty, which suggests an infection involving the prosthetic joint. Given the context, the most likely pathogens are those associated with post-surgical infections, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are known to cause infections in prosthetic joints. However, Escherichia coli is not typically associated with prosthetic joint infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause infections but is less common in prosthetic joint infections compared to staphylococci. Therefore, between the options, Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most likely causal organism.

Answer: A",1876
232,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, right shoulder pain, generalized abdominal pain, and paroxysmal cough. These symptoms suggest a possible cholangitis or cholecystitis given the liver tenderness and right shoulder pain (referred pain). The abdominal ultrasound would be crucial to confirm gallstones or cholangitis. Given the clinical presentation and the need to rule out biliary obstruction, antibiotics and drainage are the best initial steps.

Answer: C",1927
233,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include thickened skin with multiple lesions and loss of sensation in extremities, which are characteristic of leprosy (Hansen's disease). Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an acid-fast bacterium. The other options do not fit the context: catalase-negative bacteria, thermophiles, and tennis-racket shaped organisms (which would suggest spirochetes) are not associated with leprosy.

Answer: A",1677
234,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a growing axillary mass, recurrent fevers, weight loss, and elevated serum calcium with low PTH levels. These findings are consistent with a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by a malignancy producing PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), which can cause hypercalcemia without elevating PTH levels. The lymph node biopsy showing large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei suggests a diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma known to produce PTHrP. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well.

Answer: D",1927
235,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient recently traveled to Guatemala and has anti-HAV IgM positive, indicating an acute infection with Hepatitis A virus. Anti-HAV IgG negative suggests he has not had a previous infection. HBsAg, HBcAg, and other hepatitis B and C markers are negative, ruling out hepatitis B and C infections. Therefore, the patient's findings indicate an active hepatitis A infection.

Answer: A",1229
236,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The child develops severe sunburns even with sunscreen, indicating a defect in repairing UV-induced DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is responsible for removing bulky lesions caused by UV radiation, such as thymine dimers. Non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination are involved in double-strand break repair, and mismatch repair corrects base mismatches. Given the sunburns and ocular irritation, NER is the most likely impaired process.

Answer: A",1294
237,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's presentation includes a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid mass, along with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer. This combination points towards medullary thyroid cancer, which typically shows stromal amyloid deposition in the tumor stroma. The other options do not fit the context as well:
- Option A (lymphoid cells) suggests lymphoma, which is less common in this scenario.
- Option B (fibroinflammatory infiltrate) is more indicative of conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
- Option C (undifferentiated cells) is characteristic of anaplastic carcinoma, which is rare and aggressive.

Answer: D",2205
238,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: Incidence rates represent new cases occurring during a specified time period, while prevalence rates reflect the total number of existing cases at a given time. Shorter time periods capture fewer new cases, leading to lower incidence rates, whereas longer time periods include more prevalent cases, potentially overestimating the prevalence if the time window includes older cases. Attack rates refer to the frequency of new cases, which does not directly influence the incidence or prevalence estimates in the context of this study.

Answer: B",1916
239,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive weakness, shortness of breath, and a characteristic rash on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows, which are classic features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The diffuse dry crackles on lung auscultation suggest interstitial lung disease, a common complication of SLE. Given these findings, a serum ANA titer would be the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis as it is a sensitive screening test for SLE. A muscle biopsy and skin biopsy are less likely given the pulmonary involvement and the specific rash pattern, while a CT scan does not directly address the suspected autoimmune etiology.

Answer: C",1922
240,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a long-standing cough, hemoptysis, and a localized lung opacity, consistent with small cell carcinoma of the lung. Small cell carcinoma typically expresses neuroendocrine markers and is associated with elevated levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Bence-Jones protein is more commonly associated with multiple myeloma. Calcitonin is not typically elevated in lung cancer. CA 15-3 is a marker for breast cancer and is unlikely to be elevated in this case.
Answer: D",2932
241,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain localized above the umbilicus, improvement with eating, and a positive stool guaiac test suggest peptic ulcer disease. Endoscopy would typically show a mucosal defect such as an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum. The other options (urease-producing organism, PAS-positive material, and crypt abscesses) are more indicative of conditions like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, Whipple's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively, which do not align with the given symptoms.

Answer: A",2317
242,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a low hairline and a broad chest, which could suggest Turner syndrome. However, absent Barr bodies would be confirmed by a buccal smear, which is not mentioned. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase can indicate liver or bone disease but is not specifically related to the given symptoms. Elevated serum TSH could indicate hypothyroidism, but there is no indication of thyroid issues. A mass in the sella turcica could suggest a pituitary adenoma, but there are no specific neurological signs or symptoms to suggest this.

Answer: C",2231
243,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient experienced muscle pain and weakness after starting rosuvastatin, which resolved upon discontinuation. These symptoms are consistent with statin myopathy. Restarting the same statin or a different statin could potentially cause the same issue. Fish oils are not effective for lowering LDL cholesterol significantly. Fenofibrate can be used for triglyceride reduction and modest LDL reduction, but it is not the first choice for primary hyperlipidemia control. Therefore, the best next step is to initiate fenofibrate.

Answer: B",2040
244,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The specimen contains type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate, which are characteristic of cartilaginous tissue. The pinna and larynx contain cartilage, but the larynx also contains other structures like the vocal cords. The blood vessel and lens do not contain these components. Therefore, the larynx is the most likely origin.

Answer: D",1086
245,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has acute respiratory distress with bilateral rales, hypoxemia (pO2 54 mm Hg), and a pH of 7.44 indicating normal acid-base balance. The low pO2 suggests the need for better oxygenation. Increasing the FiO2, tidal volume, or respiratory rate would directly address the hypoxemia. However, increasing PEEP might be more appropriate as it can improve oxygenation without increasing the risk of barotrauma or hypercapnia. Given the current settings, increasing PEEP could optimize lung recruitment and improve oxygenation.

Answer: C",2547
246,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever, hypotension, and a high-pitched systolic murmur. The initial blood culture is positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Given the clinical presentation and the initial positive culture, it is important to ensure the accuracy of the initial result before considering further steps. Repeating blood cultures 24 hours after the initial draw can help confirm the presence of the same organism, which would support the diagnosis of bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus.

Answer: B",2036
247,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and weight loss, along with acid-fast organisms in blood cultures and a positive PPD skin test. These findings suggest tuberculosis (TB) as the most likely diagnosis. Voriconazole is used for fungal infections, erythromycin is an antibiotic for bacterial infections, and azithromycin is also an antibiotic. However, amphotericin B and itraconazole are used for fungal infections, which do not align with the clinical presentation. Therefore, the appropriate pharmacotherapy for TB would be a combination of antibiotics like azithromycin and ethambutol.

Answer: D",2667
248,Mechanism,False,C,B,"Reasoning: Carcinoma-in-situ, also known as carcinoma *in situ* or CIS, refers to cancer that is confined to the layer of cells where it originated and has not invaded deeper tissues. The activation of phosphoprotein p53 is a key event in the development of many carcinomas, including those associated with HPV infection. p53 plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and its activation can lead to the arrest of cell division or induction of apoptosis if DNA damage is too extensive to repair. This aligns with the pathogenesis of HPV-induced cervical carcinoma-in-situ.

Answer: C",1541
249,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive test result truly have the disease, while the negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that subjects with a negative test result do not have the disease. 

- **Decrease in Prevalence**: As the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the proportion of true positives relative to the total number of positive test results (which includes both true positives and false positives) will decrease. This leads to a decrease in PPV because fewer of those with a positive test result actually have the disease. Conversely, the proportion of true negatives relative to the total number of negative test results (which includes both true negatives and false negatives) will increase, leading to an increase in NPV because more of those with a negative test result do not have the disease.

Answer: B",2000
250,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's behavior of setting up bear traps and wearing a garlic necklace suggests delusions of persecution and paranoia, indicative of a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional disorder. Given her lack of significant past psychiatric history and denial of hallucinations, a psychotic disorder seems likely. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective for managing symptoms of psychosis, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is typically reserved for severe cases where other treatments have failed. Outpatient group therapy could be beneficial but is not the best initial approach. The patient does not require any intervention as a first step, given the need for a proper psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis.

Answer: A",1513
251,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with urinary hesitancy and nocturia, which are common symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The digital rectal exam showed a slightly enlarged prostate, and the PSA level is elevated at 6 ng/mL. These findings suggest BPH. Clonidine is used for hypertension and urinary retention but does not address the underlying BPH. Dihydrotestosterone is an androgen that can contribute to BPH but is not a medication. Furosemide is a diuretic used for fluid retention and hypertension, not for BPH. Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor that reduces DHT levels, thereby shrinking the prostate and improving BPH symptoms.

Answer: B",2277
252,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include falling asleep during meetings despite adequate nighttime sleep and no other sleep disturbances like snoring or breathing issues. The sleep study shows a short mean sleep latency of 6 minutes, indicating excessive daytime sleepiness rather than sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. Methylphenidate is used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, but there is no indication of ADHD in this case. Imipramine is used for depression and anxiety, not specifically for excessive daytime sleepiness. Increasing daytime naps might provide temporary relief but is not a long-term solution. Sodium oxybate is indicated for cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B",2002
253,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a painless, cystic, nontender, and transilluminating mass in the right scrotum. These findings are consistent with a patent processus vaginalis, which typically presents as a communicating hydrocele that transilluminates and can be reduced. The mass does not increase in size on coughing, and there are no bowel sounds, ruling out an inguinal hernia. The absence of testicular abnormalities and the lack of tenderness also rule out other causes like torsion or tumors. The history of a family member with a seminoma is not relevant to the current presentation.

Answer: A",2202
254,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a wound dehiscence with necrotic tissue and pus, indicating infection and poor healing. Debridement is necessary to remove the dead tissue and promote healing. Negative pressure wound management can be used after debridement to enhance healing, but it is not the initial step. Sternal wiring and fixation are typically used for sternal instability, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is surgical debridement.

Answer: A",2421
255,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Thalassemia intermedia typically presents with microcytic hypochromic red blood cells due to reduced β-globin production. The Kozak sequence mutation affects translation efficiency but not completely, resulting in a moderate form of thalassemia. Degmacytes (bite cells) are associated with oxidative hemolysis, not directly with thalassemia. Macrocytic and hyperchromic cells are not characteristic of thalassemia intermedia.

Answer: C",1586
256,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient describes a lesion on his scalp, which is a common location for seborrheic keratoses. Seborrheic keratoses are benign skin growths that appear as raised, waxy, or greasy lesions and are more common in older individuals. Given the patient's age and the description of the lesion, seborrheic keratoses fit well. Psoriasis typically presents with red, scaly patches and is less likely to be a single, raised lesion. Actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma are more concerning for skin cancer and would present with more irregular borders and potential for growth or change over time, which is not described here.

Answer: B",1908
257,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has persistent head lag, blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia, along with elevated serum prolactin levels. These findings suggest a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU), where there is a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase leading to accumulation of phenylalanine and subsequent hyperphenylalaninemia. The special diet would have reduced phenylalanine levels but not addressed the underlying enzyme deficiency. Tyrosine supplementation can help manage PKU by providing an alternative source of aromatic amino acids. Pyridoxine, thiamine, and tetrahydrobiopterin do not directly address the primary defect in phenylalanine metabolism.

Answer: A",1717
258,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of anemia, including fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, along with a low hemoglobin level and a low mean corpuscular volume. These symptoms are consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. The PPD skin test and chest X-ray findings suggest active tuberculosis, which can lead to chronic blood loss and iron deficiency. The other options (inhibition of ferrochelatase, increased homocysteine degradation, increased GABA production, and decreased ALA synthesis) do not directly relate to the presented symptoms and laboratory findings.

Answer: A",2285
259,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which leads to excessive iron absorption from the diet. The patient's normal serum iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, and liver enzymes (AST and ALT) do not suggest hemochromatosis. The BCR-ABL gene is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer, and FA genes are linked to Fanconi anemia. None of these are related to iron metabolism or hemochromatosis.

Answer: D",1925
260,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, which is consistent with appendicitis. The pain is localized and does not improve with pressure, and there are no signs of other conditions like urinary tract infection (no nausea/vomiting, normal urinalysis). The elevated white blood cell count and slightly elevated CRP support an inflammatory process. Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis. Methotrexate and nitrofurantoin are not indicated for appendicitis. Reassurance alone is insufficient without further evaluation. Referral for surgery is the most appropriate next step to prevent potential complications.

Answer: D",2908
261,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include abdominal pain and watery diarrhea that started shortly after consuming food at a barbecue without proper refrigeration. This suggests a rapid onset of symptoms consistent with a foodborne illness. Among the options, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and V. cholerae are all potential causes, but L. monocytogenes typically causes more severe systemic symptoms like fever and can lead to invasive infections. S. aureus often causes localized skin infections and food poisoning with more localized symptoms. V. cholerae causes severe watery diarrhea but is less likely given the lack of significant dehydration and no mention of cholera-like symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause is L. monocytogenes.

Answer: B",2101
262,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with confusion, lethargy, and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, along with hyponatremia (serum sodium 119 mEq/L) and elevated ADH. This suggests SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). Hyponatremia and elevated ADH are consistent with SIADH. 

- **Serum Osmolality**: In SIADH, serum osmolality is typically low due to the excess water retention.
- **Urine Sodium**: In SIADH, urine sodium is usually low because the kidneys retain sodium.
- **Serum Aldosterone**: Aldosterone levels are not directly affected by SIADH; they remain normal unless there is an underlying adrenal insufficiency, which is not indicated here.

Thus, the correct set of findings is: Low osmolality, low urine sodium, and normal aldosterone.

Answer: B",1692
263,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's fear of dogs is severe and avoidance behaviors are evident, indicating a specific phobia. Systematic desensitization is specifically designed to treat such fears through gradual exposure combined with relaxation techniques. SSRIs and benzodiazepines can help manage anxiety but do not address the root cause of the phobia. Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective for various anxiety disorders but is not as targeted for specific phobias as systematic desensitization.

Answer: C",1988
264,Acute Right Heart Failure,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient had an acute drop in blood pressure during surgery, ST elevations in multiple leads, and a 2/6 systolic murmur. These findings suggest myocardial injury or infarction. The presence of diffuse crackles and a 2/6 systolic murmur could indicate cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion, which can lead to hemodynamic instability. However, the presence of ST elevations and the rapid progression to death point more towards a direct myocardial event such as a myocardial free wall rupture, which can rapidly lead to hemodynamic collapse and death.

Answer: C",2739
265,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and work in a shipyard, suggesting exposure to asbestos. The chest radiograph shows increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and pleural plaques, consistent with asbestos-related lung disease. Honeycombing is a characteristic finding of advanced pulmonary fibrosis associated with asbestos exposure. Air bronchograms can occur in various conditions but are not specifically indicative of asbestos exposure. Nodular masses along pleural surfaces are more suggestive of mesothelioma, and lower lobe cavitary masses are less common in asbestos-related lung disease.
Answer: B",1856
266,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increasing shortness of breath, a productive cough, and a history of smoking, indicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The physical exam shows diminished breath sounds, a barrel-shaped chest, and pursed-lip breathing, consistent with COPD. The chest X-ray findings of a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation are also consistent with COPD. The pulmonary function test (FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%) suggests airflow limitation. Given these findings, the patient is likely hyperventilating due to the respiratory distress, leading to a primary respiratory alkalosis. This would be followed by compensatory mechanisms to correct the pH, but the initial ABGs would show a primary respiratory alkalosis.

Answer: B",2246
267,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. Males with hemophilia A are affected because they have one X chromosome carrying the mutation. Females can be carriers if they inherit the mutated X chromosome but may also be affected if they inherit two mutated X chromosomes. Since the male patient has hemophilia A, he must have inherited the mutated X chromosome from his mother, making his mother a carrier. His unaffected daughters would each have a 50% chance of being carriers since they each received one X chromosome from their mother (the carrier) and one from their father (normal). Therefore, the second daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier.

Answer: C",1124
268,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include progressive hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, and constant ear ringing. Otoscopic findings are unremarkable, indicating no obvious issues with the outer ear structures. The tuning fork tests show air conduction is greater than bone conduction, suggesting a conductive hearing loss. This pattern is consistent with a problem in the middle ear, specifically the malleus or incus. However, the malleus directly connects to the eardrum, and given the unremarkable appearance of the outer ear, the malleus is less likely to be directly affected. The incus is more likely to be involved in conductive hearing loss without affecting the eardrum visibly.

Answer: B",2330
269,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a deep corneal ulcer, severe conjunctival injection, and purulent discharge, which suggests a bacterial infection. Given that the treatment started with topical ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, it indicates a likely bacterial etiology. Among the options, Pseudomonas aeruginosa fits as it is known to cause severe corneal ulcers and is resistant to many antibiotics, making fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin effective. Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacilli (option B) and Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli (option C) are less commonly associated with such severe corneal ulcers. Gram-positive, optochin-sensitive diplococci (option D) are less likely given the Gram-negative nature of the suspected organism.

Answer: B",1730
270,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms, including numbness and tingling, weakness, difficulty with walking, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction, along with bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia, and clonus, are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is characterized by inflammation and demyelination in the CNS, often leading to oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The presence of 14-3-3 protein and decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance are more indicative of infectious processes like meningitis. Decreased IgG CSF concentration is not typical in MS. Therefore, the most likely finding is oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis.

Answer: C",2048
271,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's dipstick test showed 1+ glucose, indicating the presence of glucose in the urine. This could be due to glycosuria, which can occur in diabetes mellitus, particularly in pregnant women. Given the patient's age and the presence of glucose in the urine, it is important to rule out diabetes. The fasting glucose level of 97 mg/L is within the normal range, but it may not be sufficient to diagnose diabetes definitively. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes and would help confirm the presence of glucose in the urine.

Answer: D",2521
272,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a defect in activated regulatory T cells due to a mutation in the FOXP3 gene, indicating an immune dysregulation. This is characteristic of IPEX syndrome, which is associated with severe immune dysregulation and can present with eczema and diarrhea. The FOXP3 gene mutation leads to a defect in T-cell regulation, resulting in a hyperactive immune response rather than a coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Ocular telangiectasias and retained primary teeth are not typically associated with this condition. Therefore, the patient is not at increased risk for hemorrhagic diathesis.

Answer: A",1899
273,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with chronic upper abdominal pain, weight loss, and bulky, foul-smelling stools. These symptoms suggest a condition such as peptic ulcer disease or malignancy, given the long duration and weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) is the most appropriate next step to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract and identify any lesions, ulcers, or masses. 

Answer: D",1834
274,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a rapidly developing, dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug, consistent with a keratoacanthoma. This lesion grows quickly and has a characteristic appearance with a central keratin plug. While basal cell carcinoma can present as a dome-shaped nodule, it typically does not have a central keratin plug. Seborrheic keratoses are benign and do not grow rapidly. Kaposi's sarcoma, while it can present with skin lesions, is not typically associated with a central keratin plug. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is keratoacanthoma.

Answer: A",2166
275,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with exertional chest pain, which is common in patients with coronary artery disease. During exertion, the heart muscle requires more oxygen, and local substances are released to increase coronary blood flow. Adenosine is known to be released locally in the heart during ischemia to dilate coronary arteries and increase blood flow. Inorganic phosphate, prostaglandin E2, and transforming growth factor beta do not have a direct role in increasing coronary blood flow during exertion.

Answer: A",2122
276,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a low platelet count (20,000/mm³) and a rash, which could indicate thrombocytopenia. Given the context of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma and the need to optimize chemotherapy dosing, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy to increase platelets is recombinant interleukin-11 (rhIL-11).

Answer: C",2511
277,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of chronic pain and has been taking over-the-counter pain medications. Renal function has deteriorated, with elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria. A renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis does not typically present with eosinophilic infiltration or diffuse parenchymal inflammation. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis and nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis usually present with more pronounced tubular damage and often have a specific cause like medication or ischemia. Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation, which aligns with the biopsy findings.

Answer: D",1486
278,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has COPD, a history of similar presentations, and is currently hypoxic despite initial interventions. Bilateral wheezes and poor air movement suggest severe airway obstruction. BiPAP (Bi-level positive airway pressure) could be beneficial but is not indicated for acute severe airway obstruction without evidence of pneumothorax or hemothorax. Chest tube placement and needle decompression are reserved for cases of pneumothorax or hemothorax. Given the patient's severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia, intubation is necessary to secure the airway and provide adequate ventilation.

Answer: C",2328
279,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with low back pain, weight loss, constipation, difficulty urinating, and neurologic deficits including decreased sensation and muscle weakness. These symptoms suggest spinal cord compression from metastatic lung cancer. The chest x-ray shows multiple round opacities in both lungs, consistent with lung cancer. Given these findings, radiation therapy is the most appropriate next step to relieve spinal cord compression and manage symptoms.

Answer: A",2808
280,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's fear of flying is a specific phobia, which is an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation. The patient recognizes that his fear is irrational but still avoids flying, leading to significant distress and impairment in his relationships and career. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard for treating specific phobias as it directly addresses and modifies the patient's thoughts and behaviors related to the fear. Alprazolam and fluoxetine are medications typically used for anxiety disorders but do not address the underlying cognitive and behavioral issues. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on unconscious conflicts, which are not the primary issue here. Therefore, CBT is the best therapy for this patient.

Answer: B",2421
281,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with tense, pruritic bullae, and a skin biopsy shows linear immunofluorescence with IgG antibodies. This pattern is characteristic of linear deposition at the dermoepidermal junction, which is associated with hemidesmosomes. Desmosomes are not typically involved in the formation of blisters, gap junctions are involved in cell communication rather than adhesion, and tight junctions are more relevant to sealing the apical-basolateral surface. Therefore, the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind is hemidesmosomes.

Answer: C",1523
282,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include a lack of interest in social relationships, coming up with excuses to avoid social events, and a preference for solitary activities. These align well with schizoid personality disorder, which is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships and a tendency toward a solitary lifestyle. The patient's thought process being organized and logical and having a flat affect further support this diagnosis. Antisocial personality disorder involves a disregard for the rights of others, which is not indicated here. Schizophreniform disorder requires symptoms for at least a month but not meeting the full criteria for schizophrenia, which is not supported by the given information. Autism spectrum disorder involves difficulties in social communication and interaction, which are not specifically mentioned.

Answer: A",1890
283,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a high-grade fever, cough, and lung infiltrate on chest X-ray, consistent with pneumonia. The symptoms have a gradual onset and have worsened over time. The presence of a productive cough and green sputum suggests a bacterial etiology. Among the options, Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to cause pneumonia with these specific symptoms, including lobar involvement and a productive cough. Mycoplasma pneumoniae typically presents with atypical pneumonia without the typical lobar pattern seen here. Chlamydophila pneumoniae also causes pneumonia but is less commonly associated with severe lobar infiltrates. Haemophilus influenzae can cause pneumonia but is more commonly associated with otitis media and sinusitis rather than the described lung infiltrate.

Answer: A",2421
284,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling, indicative of heart failure. The presence of an S3 gallop and coarse crepitations suggests left-sided heart failure. The prescribed medication changes his cardiac physiology, likely aiming to reduce the workload on the heart. Among the options, only reduction in myocardial contractility (Option D) directly addresses this need by decreasing the heart's workload. The other options do not directly relate to the symptoms or the physiological changes seen in heart failure.

Answer: D",2460
285,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, and weight loss, along with a bronze discoloration of the skin. These symptoms are consistent with Addison's disease, an adrenal insufficiency. The bronze discoloration (hyperpigmentation) is a hallmark sign of Addison's disease. An ACTH stimulation test can confirm the diagnosis by assessing the adrenal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone. 

Answer: D",2705
286,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The question asks for an assay to detect the genetic material of HIV in a newborn. ELISA and rapid HIV antibody tests detect antibodies, not genetic material. Southern blot is a more complex technique typically used for specific gene analysis rather than routine clinical testing. PCR is the gold standard for detecting viral RNA/DNA directly. 

Answer: C",1602
287,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including fever, greenish-yellow sputum, and increased respiratory symptoms despite COPD management. These symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, particularly given the presence of purulent sputum. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can be effective against a range of bacteria, including those responsible for respiratory infections. Given the patient's history of COPD and the need for broad-spectrum coverage, erythromycin is a reasonable choice. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are also broad-spectrum antibiotics but are less commonly used for respiratory infections compared to macrolides. Antibiotics are generally indicated in such cases unless there is evidence of a non-infectious etiology.

Answer: C",2378
288,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of fever, irritability, neck rigidity, and current symptoms of headaches, nausea, and vomiting, along with the MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlarged subarachnoid space, are consistent with tuberculous meningitis. This condition typically leads to increased intracranial pressure due to impaired CSF absorption, resulting in these findings. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Answer: C",1759
289,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include unsteady gait, falls, and twitching, which suggest a neurologic disorder. The presence of an abdominal mass indicates a primary renal origin. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults but rarely affects young children. The histopathologic features of RCC typically include abortive glomeruli and tubules in a spindle cell stroma. The other options describe features of different tumors: lymphoblastic lymphoma (starry sky pattern), medulloblastoma (small blue cells arranged in rosettes), and hepatoblastoma (hepatocytes in fetal and embryonic stages).

Answer: B",1284
290,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The p-value of 0.052 indicates the probability of observing a difference in reduction of LDL of 11 mg/dL or greater by chance if the two medications have identical effects. Option A incorrectly interprets the p-value as the number of experiments showing similar results. Option C misinterprets the p-value as the chance that the difference reflects reality, which is not accurate. Option D incorrectly states it is statistically significant when the p-value is above the conventional threshold of 0.05.

Answer: B",1656
291,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a cord-like rash on her left calf that is red and painful to touch, along with a lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities. These symptoms are characteristic of cutaneous manifestations seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additionally, the patient has a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions, which can be associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, where anti-cardiolipin antibodies are commonly found. Anti-centromere, anti-histone, and anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are more commonly associated with other conditions such as CREST syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren's syndrome, respectively. Given the context of SLE and the presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies in SLE, the most likely antibody found in this patient's blood is anti-cardiolipin.

Answer: A",2314
292,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium, which is a potential source of emboli. This tumor could dislodge and travel to the brain or other vital organs, leading to sudden cardiac death or septic embolism. However, the most immediate and critical risk is sudden cardiac death due to the potential for the tumor to obstruct the left atrium or left ventricle, leading to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.

Answer: B",2453
293,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with respiratory distress, facial edema, and audible stridor, which are classic signs of anaphylaxis. Given her history of severe peanut allergy and asthma, these symptoms are consistent with a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylactic hypersensitivity). Immediate treatment for anaphylaxis involves administering epinephrine intramuscularly to counteract the allergic reaction. Oral or topical antihistamines (diphenhydramine) and inhaled medications (sodium cromolyn) are not sufficient for immediate management of anaphylaxis.

Answer: A",2512
294,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The biopsy shows uniform squamous cells in layers. This indicates a transformation of the original columnar epithelium to squamous epithelium, which is a hallmark of metaplasia. Dysplasia involves abnormal cell growth and is typically associated with precancerous changes, while anaplasia refers to the loss of differentiation in cancer cells. Normal epithelium would show no such transformation.
Answer: A",1166
295,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has severe facial acne, dense black hairs, and enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts, indicating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS increases the risk of endometrial carcinoma due to hormonal imbalances leading to irregular periods and potential endometrial hyperplasia. The other conditions (Addison disease, Wegener granulomatosis, and eclampsia) do not align with the given symptoms.

Answer: A",1771
296,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The lesion is described as having neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin, indicating a potential melanoma. Melanomas often show atypical pigmentation, such as different colors within the same lesion. Option A describes this atypical pigmentation, which is common in melanomas. Options B, C, and D describe features more consistent with benign lesions or other conditions rather than melanoma.

Answer: A",1292
297,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of a right-sided subdural hematoma and now presents with fatigue and headaches, along with hyponatremia (serum Na+ 130 mEq/L). This suggests the development of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), which is common after brain injuries. Tolvaptan is a selective V2 receptor antagonist used to treat hyponatremia associated with SIADH. Desmopressin would worsen hyponatremia. Head elevation and fluid restriction are supportive but not specific treatments for hyponatremia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to initiate tolvaptan.

Answer: B",1725
298,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is an 18-month-old girl with vaginal bleeding, limping, and left leg pain. The presence of multiple hyperpigmented patches on the trunk and bilateral breast enlargement without pubic hair suggests precocious puberty. The plain radiograph showing patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis is consistent with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, which is often seen in McCune–Albright syndrome. This condition can present with precocious puberty and skin mottling due to fibrous dysplasia. Other options like bitemporal hemianopsia, hypertension, and pheochromocytoma do not fit the clinical presentation.

Answer: D",1921
299,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The relationship between the diameter of a vessel and resistance to blood flow can be described by Poiseuille's law, which states that resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (or diameter squared). Since the diameter is reduced by 50%, the new diameter is 50% of the original, meaning the radius is also 50% of the original. Squaring this gives \(0.5^2 = 0.25\), and the inverse of this is \(1/0.25 = 4\). Thus, the resistance increases by a factor of 4.

Answer: D",934
300,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include an irregular gait and pelvic tilt when standing on one leg, indicating a neurological issue affecting the muscles and nerves in the affected leg. The location of the vaccine injection is crucial. Given that the left leg drops and the pelvis tilts towards the left, the injury likely affects the right side, as the left side is not showing any abnormality. The superior gluteal nerve, which innervates the muscles of the thigh and hip, is most likely affected if the injection was in the inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock, causing weakness in the right leg.

Answer: A",1448
301,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli, indicating a Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma). This tumor arises from the metanephric blastema, which is derived from the mesoderm. The adrenal medulla, thyroid gland, and anterior pituitary all originate from different embryonic layers: the adrenal medulla from the neural crest, the thyroid from the pharyngeal pouches, and the anterior pituitary from the oral ectoderm. The papillary muscles, however, are derived from the mesoderm, just like the metanephric blastema. Therefore, the tumor is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as the papillary muscles.

Answer: C",2148
302,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and anterior lenticonus, which are characteristic features of Alport syndrome. Additionally, the presence of microscopic hematuria (blood in urine) and proteinuria supports this diagnosis. The family history of renal transplantation in the father is also consistent with Alport syndrome, as it often leads to end-stage kidney disease requiring transplantation. There is no evidence of polycystic disease or tumors, which would be expected in Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Therefore, the findings best explain Alport syndrome.

Answer: A",2237
303,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has delayed menarche despite normal breast development and growth spurt, which suggests delayed puberty. The headaches with photosensitivity and nausea could indicate hyperprolactinemia, as elevated prolactin can cause these symptoms. The normal laboratory values and imaging do not suggest an obstruction or structural abnormality. Given the clinical presentation and hormonal levels, hyperprolactinemia is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A",2102
304,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds, and a low SpO2 of 89% on room air, which improves to 75 mm Hg after oxygen administration. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a normal pH, low PaCO2, and a normal HCO3-. These findings suggest a ventilatory defect rather than a metabolic acid-base disorder. The peak expiratory flow rate is within normal limits, and there is no evidence of ARDS or neuromuscular disease. The history of recurrent episodes similar to asthma attacks supports the diagnosis of an asthma attack.

Answer: A",2603
305,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, scleral icterus, and a flapping tremor (Chvostek's sign), indicating Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, likely due to thiamine deficiency. The improvement in mental status and resolution of the tremor suggest thiamine administration. Lactulose can cause diarrhea and flatulence, but does not typically resolve tremors. Naloxone is used for opioid overdose and would not explain the tremor or mental status changes. Rifaximin is used for non-infectious gastrointestinal conditions and does not address the neurological symptoms.

Answer: A",2107
306,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain and constipation, which suggests a possible obstruction or inflammation in the right side of the abdomen. The colonoscopy from a year ago showed multiple small, pedunculated polyps and colonic mucosal outpouchings, which are consistent with diverticulosis. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder do not typically present with right lower quadrant pain and constipation. Goodpasture syndrome primarily affects the kidneys and lungs, not the gastrointestinal tract. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause joint pain and hypermobility but does not specifically correlate with the described gastrointestinal symptoms.

Answer: C",3143
307,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's daughter does not consent to the life-saving surgery, despite the physician stressing its necessity. Given that the patient has no written advanced directive, the decision should ideally be made based on the patient's best interests. The daughter's refusal appears to be based on personal reasons rather than the patient's welfare. Reporting the daughter to the police is an extreme measure and not the most appropriate course of action. Referring the case to the court could be considered, but contacting another family member for consent might be more immediate. However, the daughter's refusal to consent is a significant barrier to proceeding without a court order.

Answer: B",2577
308,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) primarily acts to increase sodium excretion and promote diuresis, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. This aligns with increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), restricted aldosterone release, and vascular smooth muscle dilation, which are key actions of ANP. It does not lead to vasoconstriction or increased blood pressure, nor does it directly affect water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts or plasma calcium levels.

Answer: C",1277
309,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15, indicating impaired consciousness. Informed consent is typically required before performing any medical procedures, including a needle thoracostomy. However, given the patient's current state, obtaining consent from the patient or their legally authorized representative is not feasible. The closest relatives (spouse, child, or parent) would be the appropriate individuals to provide informed consent. Witnesses at the scene of the accident are not legally authorized to provide consent, and the hospital ethics committee is not necessary for this immediate intervention.

Answer: A",3043
310,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The study aims to evaluate the relationship between HIV and high-risk behaviors in female sex workers, as well as the association with sociodemographic factors. The main focus is on understanding the frequency of HIV among this population and its relation to various factors. Prevalence measures the existing cases of a condition in a population at a specific time, which fits the study's objective of evaluating the current rate of HIV among female sex workers. Incidence would measure the rate of new cases, hazard rate is used in survival analysis, and attributable risk assesses the contribution of a specific factor to the risk of an outcome. Therefore, prevalence is the most appropriate measure.

Answer: B",2072
311,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with anemia, pale conjunctivae, and a polypoid mass in the ascending colon. These findings suggest a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, specifically a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The key process involved in colorectal cancer pathogenesis is often the accumulation of mutations leading to uncontrolled cell growth, which can involve the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Impaired degradation of β-catenin leads to its accumulation and activation of transcription factors, promoting cancer development.

Answer: C",1513
312,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, low back pain, and abnormal laboratory results including elevated creatinine and BUN levels, indicating kidney dysfunction. The presence of large eosinophilic casts on renal biopsy suggests a glomerular disease, possibly allergic glomerulonephritis or other conditions associated with eosinophilia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, often seen in these conditions, leads to the formation of schistocytes due to mechanical damage to red blood cells as they pass through narrowed vessels. This process does not typically lead to reticulocytosis, linear aggregations of red blood cells, or leukocytosis with mature myeloid cells.

Answer: C",1794
313,Lisinopril,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 95-year-old with multiple comorbidities and is experiencing confusion, delirium, and disorientation. These symptoms are indicative of delirium, often caused by medication side effects or other underlying conditions. Metformin is not commonly associated with confusion or delirium. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and is not known to cause confusion. Oxybutynin can cause anticholinergic side effects such as confusion and delirium, especially in elderly patients. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is less likely to cause confusion. Given the patient's age and the presence of anticholinergic burden, oxybutynin is the most likely culprit.

Answer: B",2123
314,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, which are classic signs of allergic rhinitis. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, would be appropriate for these symptoms. However, the question does not mention any vasoconstrictive or sympathomimetic effects, ruling out alpha-adrenergic agonists and short-acting beta-2 agonists. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors and disruption of disulfide bonds are not relevant to histamine-mediated symptoms. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action is an antihistamine.

Answer: A",2172
315,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with changing finger discoloration (white to red to blue), fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. These symptoms suggest a systemic autoimmune disease. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies indicate involvement of connective tissues, which aligns with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Polymyositis typically presents with muscle weakness without the characteristic skin changes seen in MCTD. Systemic sclerosis primarily affects the skin and can cause Raynaud's phenomenon but does not usually present with anti-U1 RNP antibodies. Rheumatoid arthritis is less likely given the absence of joint swelling and the presence of muscle symptoms.

Answer: A",1440
316,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior suggests a history of bulimia nervosa. Fluoxetine is commonly used to treat bulimia nervosa, so it is a potential option. However, bupropion is not typically associated with treating bulimia nervosa and may exacerbate binge eating behaviors due to its stimulant properties. Citalopram and trazodone are both antidepressants but do not have specific indications for bulimia nervosa. Therefore, bupropion should be avoided in this patient.

Answer: A",2110
317,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's vision has improved to the point where he no longer needs glasses for driving, which suggests a change in refractive error. Denaturation of lens protein (cataract) can cause progressive vision changes and the need for changing glasses. Liquefaction of the vitreous body typically causes floaters and flashes without improving vision. Increased ciliary muscle tone and lens elasticity are not directly related to the described vision improvement. Given the context of progressive vision improvement and the need for changing glasses, the most likely explanation is denaturation of lens protein leading to a developing cataract.

Answer: A",1783
318,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has recurrent visits to the ER with vague symptoms like arm pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. These symptoms are not localized to a specific organ or injury, and the arm pain does not have any signs of trauma or inflammation. The patient's history of multiple ER visits suggests a pattern of presenting with various symptoms without a clear organic cause. The lack of a definitive diagnosis and the presence of psychological distress align more with somatic symptom disorder rather than a specific physical condition like ulcerative colitis. Illness anxiety disorder involves excessive worry about having a serious illness but does not typically present with physical symptoms. Somatoform pain disorder involves pain symptoms without a clear physical cause, fitting the patient's presentation.

Answer: C",2310
319,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient describes episodes of high energy and spending money impulsively, followed by guilt, which aligns with hypomanic episodes. Additionally, he reports multiple month-long episodes of sadness, increased sleep, and lack of interest, consistent with depressive episodes. This pattern suggests a history of mood swings characteristic of bipolar disorder. However, the episodes do not meet the criteria for a full manic episode, ruling out bipolar I disorder. The patient does not have chronic symptoms of depression lasting at least two years, eliminating persistent depressive disorder. The history of meningoencephalitis and the report of seeing monkeys in the hospital room suggest a potential psychotic component, but the current presentation does not meet the criteria for schizoaffective disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is bipolar II disorder.

Answer: A",2213
320,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with worsening symptoms of bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and hypotension, indicating a possible perforated ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon. An abdominal CT scan with contrast would be more comprehensive than an abdominal x-ray or plain abdominal x-ray for evaluating the extent of inflammation and potential complications. CT angiography is not indicated for this scenario. Colonoscopy should be delayed until the patient's condition stabilizes due to the risk of perforation during the procedure.

Answer: A",2052
321,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of sudden breathlessness, sharp chest pain on inspiration, and calf pain suggest a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The low blood pressure and tachycardia further support this diagnosis. The chest X-ray being unremarkable and the ECG showing sinus tachycardia are consistent with PE. Given these findings, a ventilation-perfusion scan would be the best initial diagnostic test to confirm the presence of PE before initiating anticoagulation. An inferior vena cava filter or lower extremity Doppler ultrasound would be considered if there is a contraindication to anticoagulation or if the diagnosis is confirmed.

Answer: C",1590
322,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include frequent falls, slow and forced movements, and a shuffling gait, which are classic signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by enlarged ventricles due to excess CSF, leading to compression of the brain tissue. The histologic findings in NPH typically show atrophy of the caudate nucleus, which is one of the key features of this condition. The other options (beta-pleated sheets, alpha-synuclein inclusions, and hyperphosphorylated tau inclusions) are more commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, respectively.

Answer: B",2845
323,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with rickets, including bowed legs, stunted growth, bone pain, large forehead, and trouble sleeping. The physical examination findings such as wrist widening, leg bowing, and rib beading are classic signs of rickets. The erosion of tooth enamel and carious molars suggest nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin D deficiency, which is a common cause of rickets. The other options do not directly correlate with the presented symptoms.

Answer: C",2010
324,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with icterus, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a dilated common bile duct on ultrasound, suggesting possible choledocholithiasis or other obstructive jaundice. ERCP is the gold standard for both diagnosis and treatment of biliary obstruction, allowing direct visualization and intervention. MRCP is non-invasive but does not allow therapeutic intervention. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram is invasive and usually reserved for cases where ERCP fails. CT abdomen provides imaging but lacks the ability to perform interventions.

Answer: A",3027
325,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 31-year-old woman with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension, and bilateral upper abdominal masses on physical examination. Renal ultrasonography shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple anechoic masses. These findings are consistent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is known to present with bilateral renal cysts and hypertension. Medullary sponge kidney typically causes renal calculi and pyelonephritis but does not usually present with multiple renal cysts. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, and obstructive cystic dysplasia is less common and typically presents with hydronephrosis rather than multiple renal cysts.

Answer: B",2050
326,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms suggest a progressive hip pain, which could be related to her underlying sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis can involve various organs, including musculoskeletal involvement leading to pain. Given the progressive nature of the pain and the need for early detection of any potential musculoskeletal involvement, an MRI would provide detailed imaging to identify any soft tissue or bone involvement. While a radiograph might show some bony changes, an MRI is more sensitive for detecting soft tissue inflammation and involvement, which is crucial for diagnosing conditions related to sarcoidosis.

Answer: A",2069
327,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include swelling and pain in the right testicle, along with a history of facial swelling and fever-like symptoms 10 days prior. These symptoms are more consistent with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) rather than other conditions like appendicitis or trauma. The most likely STI given the context is *chancroid*, which is characterized by painful genital ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy. Chancroid is not preventable by a live attenuated vaccine, does not present with a painless chancre (which is more characteristic of syphilis), does not typically cause buboes, and is not a common cause of septic arthritis in this age group.

Answer: A",1865
328,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient experienced dizziness, hypotension (90/60 mm Hg), and tachycardia (68/min) after epidural anesthesia. These symptoms are consistent with hypovolemia, which can occur due to the redistribution of blood to the lower extremities during epidural anesthesia. While sympathetic block can cause hypotension, it typically presents with bradycardia rather than tachycardia. Acute pulmonary hypertension and aortocaval compression would not present with the sudden drop in blood pressure post-epidural anesthesia without other specific symptoms.

Answer: B",1818
329,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dysarthria and left-sided facial droop, which are classic symptoms of a stroke. Given the acute onset and neurological deficits, alteplase (Activase) is a potential treatment to dissolve the clot causing the stroke. Hydralazine is used for hypertension and heart failure, not for stroke. Exchange transfusion is used for severe hemolytic conditions like sickle cell crisis, not for stroke. Warfarin is an anticoagulant used for long-term prevention of clots, not for acute stroke treatment. Therefore, alteplase is the most appropriate therapy in this scenario.

Answer: A",3052
330,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient developed severe respiratory distress with crackles, indicating pulmonary involvement. The autopsy revealed heavy, red lungs, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. Histology would show changes consistent with edema rather than a large pulmonary embolus or cancer. Diaphragmatic hypertrophy is unlikely to cause such acute respiratory failure. Therefore, interstitial edema is the most likely cause.

Answer: B",2013
331,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain, which are consistent with sickle cell disease. The presence of clumped, elongated, and curved cells along with erythrocytes with nuclear remnants on the peripheral blood smear is characteristic of sickle cell disease. The hemoglobin electrophoresis result would typically show increased levels of HbS. Sickle cell trait usually does not cause such severe symptoms, and hemoglobin F is not associated with these clinical features. HbC typically causes milder anemia without the severe symptoms seen here.

Answer: B",2390
332,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness) and the elevated serum digoxin level suggest digitalis toxicity. The therapeutic range for digoxin is 0.8-2 ng/mL, while the patient's level is 3.7 ng/mL. Given the patient's history of heart failure, regular use of digoxin, and the addition of verapamil, which can inhibit the renal excretion of digoxin, the most likely mechanism is drug-induced hypokalemia. Verapamil can also inhibit the P-glycoprotein, but the primary mechanism leading to increased digoxin levels in this scenario is more likely due to the hypokalemic effect of verapamil.

Answer: A",1581
333,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has multiple injuries, including a right cheek laceration, bruising, and a right elbow and wrist swelling. There are also decreased breath sounds over the right lung base and tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall, suggesting possible rib fractures or pneumothorax. Given the presence of decreased breath sounds and chest wall tenderness, an intercostal chest tube insertion would be necessary to rule out a pneumothorax and manage potential hemothorax. 

Answer: A",2909
334,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 51-year-old woman with type II diabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, which can lead to foot problems. Regular foot exams are crucial to detect early signs of complications like ulcers or infections. Urinalysis every 6 months is recommended for diabetes management to screen for kidney damage. Weekly foot inspections by the patient or family member are more frequent than necessary and not as comprehensive as an annual exam by a healthcare provider. Meningococcal vaccine is not routinely recommended for all diabetics unless they fall into a high-risk group for meningococcal disease.

Answer: B",1940
335,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden loss of consciousness during physical exertion, which can be seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. However, HCM typically presents with palpable vibrations or a mid-systolic click, which are absent here. Aortic stenosis can cause syncope but would likely produce a systolic murmur, which is absent. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually follows emotional or physical stress but lacks the characteristic apical impulse and jugular venous findings. Restrictive cardiomyopathy can present with jugular venous distension (prominent A wave) and a double apical impulse due to right-to-left intracardiac shunting, which fits the patient’s presentation.

Answer: D",1708
336,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with recurrent headaches and unconsciousness following generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The MRI shows perivascular clusters of lymphocytes, which are characteristic of a vasculitis or immune-mediated condition. Given the patient's history of multiple sexual partners and the presence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, the most likely cause is an immune response to a viral infection. Among the options, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known to cause various malignancies and is associated with immune-mediated vasculitis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is primarily associated with skin warts and cancers, not vasculitis. Schistosoma haematobium is a parasitic infection that affects the urinary tract, not the central nervous system. Human herpes viruses are a broader category and do not specifically match the presentation.

Answer: A",2166
337,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include cyanosis, dyspnea, and a fixed splitting of S2 and a midsystolic murmur. These findings suggest a congenital heart defect, specifically a type of atrial septal defect (ASD) where the murmur and fixed splitting of S2 are characteristic. During pregnancy, the increase in blood volume and cardiac output can exacerbate the symptoms of an underlying heart defect. However, the fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur are more indicative of an ASD rather than changes in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, or blood volume alone.

Answer: D",2666
338,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with generalized malaise, severe diarrhea, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, dilated pupils, and difficulty placing an IV. These symptoms suggest a viral illness, possibly influenza, given the presence of fever and respiratory symptoms. Oseltamivir is indicated for treating influenza, but the patient's symptoms do not specifically indicate influenza. Clonidine can help with malaise and diarrhea, but it does not address the underlying cause. Diazepam is used for anxiety and muscle spasms, which are not primary concerns here. Haloperidol and diphenhydramine are used for agitation and allergic reactions, which also do not fit the presentation. 

Answer: C",2065
339,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's fear of spiders (arachnophobia) is an irrational and extreme fear that has led to physical harm and avoidance behavior. Desensitization is a form of psychotherapy that gradually exposes the patient to the feared object or situation, which is effective for phobias. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used to treat cardiovascular conditions and migraines, not phobias. Alprazolam is an anxiolytic that can provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying fear. Psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can help the patient understand and change their thought patterns related to the fear of spiders.

Answer: A",2531
340,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with forgetfulness, unsteadiness, and falls, along with decreased muscle strength in the left lower extremity and a positive Babinski sign, indicating possible neurological involvement. The CT scan of the head would help rule out structural abnormalities like hemorrhage or tumors. Given the patient's history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia, warfarin therapy is not indicated unless there is evidence of a clotting disorder. Vitamin E therapy is not typically used for cognitive decline or neurological symptoms. Tetrabenazine therapy is used for chorea associated with Huntington's disease, which is not suggested by the clinical presentation. Cognitive training can be beneficial for improving cognitive function and may help manage the forgetfulness and unsteadiness. However, the most appropriate next step is to first confirm the underlying cause with imaging.

Answer: D",2517
341,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The anesthesiologist located the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall, indicating the sciatic nerve was anesthetized. Pinching the posterior vulva did not provoke pain, confirming the sciatic nerve was anesthetized. The sciatic nerve supplies the external anal sphincter.

Answer: B",2268
342,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's presentation suggests a rapidly worsening condition, including hypotension, tachypnea, and absent breath sounds on one side, indicating possible pneumothorax or hemothorax. The tracheal deviation and distended neck veins further support this. Given the severity and rapid decline, immediate intervention is needed to relieve the airway obstruction. Discontinuing antibiotics would be inappropriate as the patient had been on them for only 30 minutes. An arterial blood gas is important but not the immediate life-saving intervention needed. A chest X-ray can provide additional information but is less urgent than needle decompression. 

Answer: C",2148
343,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset left lower abdominal pain and tenderness over the left adnexa with rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. These findings suggest a possible ovarian cyst rupture, which can cause internal bleeding and inflammation. The rectouterine pouch is the potential site for collection of such fluid due to its anatomical position between the posterior wall of the uterus and the rectum. The other options (hepatorenal space, splenorenal angle, and rectovesical pouch) do not align with the described symptoms and anatomical location.

Answer: A",2465
344,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a tremor that worsens when reaching for objects, consistent with essential tremor or a type of parkinsonism. However, the overshooting target and increased tone in the lower extremities with a positive Babinski sign suggest a lesion in the pyramidal tract, indicative of a subcortical stroke. The degenerated substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease but does not explain the specific motor signs here. Cerebellar demyelination would typically cause ataxia rather than a tremor. The caudate nucleus degeneration is less commonly associated with these specific symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause is a subthalamic nucleus stroke.

Answer: D",2641
345,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with generalized pruritus, raised erythematous plaques, and nasal symptoms consistent with an allergic reaction. The sudden onset and history of similar episodes suggest an allergic etiology. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that can provide symptomatic relief for allergic reactions. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine but is less sedating. Vitamin K is not indicated for allergic reactions. Calamine lotion is used for itch relief but does not address the underlying allergic reaction. Given the acute nature of the symptoms and the need for rapid relief, diphenhydramine is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Answer: A",1632
346,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The individual is experiencing sexual fantasies about male coworkers while joining a hate group and attacking a gay couple. This behavior indicates that he is expressing the opposite of his true feelings (desiring men) through extreme actions against them. This aligns with the definition of reaction formation, where anxiety-producing or unacceptable desires are managed by exaggerating the opposite behavior.

Answer: B",1081
347,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin, along with a pink tinge to the urine, indicating possible kidney stones. She also has hypercalcemia and elevated PTH, suggesting a disorder of calcium metabolism. Given her history of secondary symptoms like fatigue and constipation, and the context of chronic kidney disease (implied by hypercalciuria and hyperparathyroidism), the most likely cause is secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a response to chronic kidney failure.

Answer: C",2521
348,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fatigue, lack of enjoyment in activities, and severe sleep disturbances, which are indicative of depression. Given that she has not responded to initial treatment, lithium is typically used as a second-line treatment for depression that does not respond to first-line therapies. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is reserved for severe cases where immediate improvement is necessary and other treatments have failed. Changing to lithium directly would be a step beyond first-line therapy without evidence of failure of the initial treatment. Continuing the current therapy allows for a trial period to assess efficacy before considering further interventions.

Answer: C",2376
349,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has characteristics consistent with anorexia nervosa, including significant weight loss, absence of menstruation, and intense dietary restrictions. Decreased adiposity is a hallmark of anorexia nervosa and leads to hypoestrogenemia due to reduced estrogen production from adipose tissue. Insulin resistance is not typically associated with anorexia nervosa. Bone scans showing decreased calcium mineral deposits suggest osteopenia, which is common in anorexia nervosa due to malnutrition. Hyperthyroidism is unlikely given the low heart rate and normal thyroid function tests would be expected if hyperthyroidism were present.

Answer: B",2159
350,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a peritonsillar abscess, including fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and deviation of the uvula. The oropharyngeal examination shows erythematous tonsils and swelling of the right tonsillar pillar, which are classic signs. Given the acute worsening and significant pain, incision and drainage is necessary to relieve pressure and prevent airway obstruction. Oral clindamycin alone is insufficient for drainage, and dexamethasone would not address the infection. Ampicillin-sulbactam is appropriate for treating the bacterial infection but should be combined with incision and drainage for effective management.

Answer: B",2212
351,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's presentation includes fatigue, lower abdominal pain, and a request for a diagnostic laparoscopy despite normal findings. She also has a depressed mood and generalized weakness of proximal muscles, which suggest a psychological component. The presence of numerous crusts along the left arm veins and a history of factitious behavior further support a factitious disorder. The laboratory results show microcytic anemia, which can be seen in various conditions but do not specifically point to a physical cause. The absence of organic pathology on imaging and the patient's insistence on a laparoscopy despite normal findings are key indicators of a factitious disorder.

Answer: A",2892
352,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient developed symptoms five days after an appendectomy, including fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with jaundice and liver enlargement. The laboratory findings show elevated AST (760 U/L), indicating significant hepatocellular injury, and a total bilirubin level of 3.8 mg/dL with direct bilirubin of 3.1 mg/dL, suggesting hemolysis. The anti-HAV IgG positive indicates past infection with hepatitis A virus, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of acute hepatitis. There is no evidence of recent bacterial infection, gallbladder inflammation, or red blood cell lysis.

Answer: A",3093
353,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, painless bruising, petechiae, and thrombocytopenia, which are consistent with a hematologic disorder such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The low platelet count (54,000/mm³) and reticulocyte count (0.1%) suggest bone marrow failure. A bone marrow biopsy is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis by directly examining the bone marrow tissue.

Answer: B",2600
354,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing chronic upper abdominal pain despite being on a proton pump inhibitor. The doctor decides to order a urease breath test, which is used to detect H. pylori infection. Given the patient's history of NSAID use and the effectiveness of PPIs in reducing stomach acid, it is less likely that the pain is due to NSAIDs alone or excessive gastrin. Gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction typically presents with heartburn and regurgitation rather than chronic upper abdominal pain. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's chronic stomach pain is H. pylori infection.

Answer: C",2073
355,Screening,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is at low risk for sexually transmitted infections given her lack of history of risky behaviors. However, routine prenatal care guidelines recommend screening for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B in all pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission and ensure maternal and fetal health. N. gonorrhea, C. trachomatis, and hepatitis C are not universally recommended as initial screening tests in all pregnant women unless there is a specific risk factor.

Answer: A",1380
356,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's complaints include constant criticism of others, distrust, and suspiciousness, which are indicative of a pervasive pattern of distrust and paranoia. These symptoms align more closely with schizotypal personality disorder, characterized by social detachment, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and unusual beliefs. While antisocial personality disorder involves disregard for others' rights and trust issues, the patient's symptoms do not fit the criteria for ASPD. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by perfectionism and control, not distrust and jealousy. Therefore, the most fitting diagnosis is schizotypal personality disorder.

Answer: A",2014
357,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, depression, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 95 mm Hg, and bicarbonate of 24 mEq/L, indicating metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis. This combination suggests a primary respiratory cause for the acidosis, which is consistent with hypoventilation due to sedative-hypnotic overdose. Heroin is a potent respiratory depressant that can lead to hypoventilation and subsequent hypercapnia. Amitriptyline and cocaine do not typically cause such a specific pattern of acid-base disturbance. Ethylene glycol toxicity usually presents with metabolic acidosis without the respiratory alkalosis seen here.

Answer: D",1769
358,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible radial head subluxation or dislocation, given the mechanism of injury (being swung by the arms) and the localized pain on the lateral aspect of the elbow with limited supination. A radiograph is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential injuries such as a fracture. Immobilization, moderate flexion followed by hyperpronation, or supination followed by maximal extension are not appropriate initial steps without first confirming the diagnosis.

Answer: C",2194
359,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with muscle weakness affecting daily activities such as climbing stairs and brushing hair. A muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium, which is characteristic of polymyositis. Systemic lupus erythematosus typically presents with more systemic symptoms like joint pain, rash, and kidney involvement. Polymyalgia rheumatica usually presents with shoulder and pelvic girdle pain and stiffness. Dermatomyositis often includes a skin rash and muscle weakness, but the biopsy finding of CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration is more indicative of polymyositis.

Answer: C",2119
360,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include difficulty rolling, sitting unsupported, weak cry and suck, symmetric flaccid weakness of both extremities, and a bell-shaped chest. These findings suggest a generalized neuromuscular issue affecting motor function. Anterior horn cell degeneration would present with symmetric flaccid paralysis and respiratory muscle involvement, fitting the described symptoms. Axonal demyelination typically causes asymmetric weakness and sensory deficits, not the symmetric flaccidity seen here. Decreased acetylcholine receptor density is associated with myasthenia gravis, which does not explain the generalized weakness and lack of respiratory involvement. Myonecrosis involves localized muscle damage, not generalized weakness.

Answer: A",2363
361,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 6-day-old male with increasing irritability, restlessness, and a firm midline neck swelling. These symptoms suggest possible craniosynostosis, given the abnormal head shape and growth pattern. However, the firm neck swelling and increased vital signs (tachycardia and tachypnea) are concerning for a more urgent condition such as a mass effect from the craniosynostosis or another cause like a hematoma or infection. Naloxone is used to reverse opioid effects, which is not indicated here. Methimazole and propranolol are used for managing hyperthyroidism, which is less likely given the recent weight loss. Potassium iodide is used for thyroid storm management, which is not indicated without evidence of hyperthyroidism. Calcium gluconate is used for hypocalcemia, which is not suggested by the symptoms.

Answer: C",1527
362,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history of fever and bloody diarrhea two weeks ago, along with current symptoms of burning with urination, pain in the right ankle, and pain and swelling in the left knee, suggests an infectious etiology. The presence of conjunctival injection and a small left knee effusion is consistent with Kawasaki disease. However, Kawasaki disease primarily affects children under 5 years old, making this less likely in a 29-year-old man. Instead, these symptoms are more indicative of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as syphilis, given the involvement of the genitourinary tract and joints. The most characteristic finding in syphilis is a painless ulcer (chancre) at the site of infection, often in the genital area. Among the given options, tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon (heel pain) is not typical for either Kawasaki disease or syphilis. Therefore, it is the least likely finding.

Answer: D",1736
363,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a painless neck lump that has been increasing in size over 3 months. The lump is firm, irregular, and moves with swallowing, indicating a thyroid mass. Cervical lymphadenopathy is present, which can be a sign of metastasis. The ultrasound shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions, which are consistent with papillary thyroid cancer. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is planned, which aligns with the typical management of suspicious thyroid nodules. 

Answer: C",2126
364,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has diarrhea and painful muscle cramps. Methadone (A) is used for heroin addiction and withdrawal, not for diarrhea. Naloxone (B) is used to reverse opioid overdose, not for managing diarrhea or muscle cramps. Alvimopan (C) is used to prevent postoperative ileus and is not indicated for diarrhea. Loperamide (D) is effective for treating diarrhea and has a similar mechanism to diphenoxylate, making it suitable for managing the patient's diarrhea. The painful muscle cramps could be managed with analgesics, but loperamide can address the primary issue of diarrhea.

Answer: D",1838
365,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with diarrhea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and hypotension. The Darrow-Yannet diagram shows a shift towards decreased extracellular volume. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released in response to increased ventricular blood volume, which is not present here. Bradykinin and vasoactive intestinal peptide are not directly related to the fluid status changes observed. Renin is secreted in response to decreased blood pressure and volume, which aligns with the patient's hypotension and decreased extracellular volume.

Answer: C",2063
366,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient describes episodic squeezing and tightness in her chest that occurs every few days for 3 months and is not associated with food or exercise. The 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. These findings are more consistent with Raynaud's phenomenon, where transient vasospasm can cause similar symptoms. There is no evidence of aortic dissection (sudden onset, tearing pain, other organ damage), myocardial infarction (history of similar episodes, transient ST elevations), or costochondritis (typically affects multiple ribs on one side).

Answer: A",2003
367,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has symptoms consistent with rubella, including a maculopapular rash, and her serology shows recent exposure (IgM negative, IgG elevated with high avidity) but not active infection. Given that she is already pregnant, the risk of congenital rubella syndrome is present if she were to become infected now. However, since she has already been exposed and tested negative for IgM, the risk is low. Chorionic villus sampling is not indicated for this condition. Vaccination postpartum would be too late to prevent congenital rubella syndrome. Termination of pregnancy is an extreme measure not typically recommended for this condition without more severe complications. Additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19 is not necessary given the current evidence.

Answer: A",2777
368,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition, which are common symptoms of various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the presence of a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, and malodorous discharge is more indicative of trichomoniasis rather than bacterial vaginosis, which typically presents with a gray, fishy-smelling discharge. Urinary tract infection (UTI) would present with more urinary symptoms without significant vaginal discharge. Chlamydia infection usually presents with less pronounced symptoms and does not typically cause such a profuse and malodorous discharge. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is trichomoniasis.

Answer: C",1850
369,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient underwent a thyroidectomy and now has hoarseness, indicating damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This nerve arises from the 4th pharyngeal arch and runs next to the thyroid gland, making it susceptible to injury during thyroid surgery. The 6th pharyngeal arch gives rise to the superior laryngeal nerve, which is less commonly involved in this type of hoarseness. Therefore, the damaged nerve is most likely the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which originates from the 4th pharyngeal arch.

Answer: D",1539
370,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing severe shortness of breath and wheezing, indicating an acute exacerbation of asthma. The nebulized bronchodilator typically used in such cases is a beta-agonist, which works by increasing adenylate cyclase activity, leading to the production of cyclic AMP. This increases the sensitivity of the bronchial smooth muscle to acetylcholine and decreases airway resistance. Leukotriene activity is not directly affected by beta-agonists, muscarinic receptors are primarily targeted by anticholinergics, and phosphodiesterase activity is not a direct target of bronchodilators.

Answer: D",2364
371,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and splenomegaly, along with a low hemoglobin level and a leukocyte count within the normal range but with small lymphocytes. The peripheral blood smear and cell immunophenotyping indicate small lymphocytes with CD25 positivity, which is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 

- Cladribine and fludarabine are commonly used in the treatment of CLL.
- Prednisone is used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation but is not the primary therapy for CLL.
- Thalidomide is used for various conditions including multiple myeloma and skin disorders but is not the standard treatment for CLL.

Answer: A",2436
372,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with confusion, fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and localized crackles on chest examination. These symptoms suggest a possible infectious process, such as pneumonia or sepsis. Given the localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field, a chest radiography is the best initial diagnostic test to guide current therapy. This will help identify any lung pathology, such as pneumonia, which could explain the respiratory symptoms and confusion.

Answer: A",2216
373,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive pain and blurry vision in one eye, which is a classic symptom of keratitis. The presence of a whitish exudate at the bottom of the anterior chamber and a round corneal infiltrate is consistent with herpes simplex keratitis. The other options are less likely: angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with severe eye pain, redness, and nausea; epidemic keratoconjunctivitis affects both eyes and causes watery discharge; pseudomonas keratitis is more common in contact lens wearers and presents with greenish discharge and rapid corneal ulceration. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is herpes simplex keratitis.

Answer: C",2157
374,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history of hiking in the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, along with the chest X-ray and CT findings, suggests a pulmonary infection. The presence of necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the lung biopsy points towards a mycobacterial infection rather than a fungal infection like histoplasmosis. Mycetoma is unlikely given the absence of skin lumps and weeping sinuses. Blastomycosis would typically present with a positive acid-fast stain, which is negative here. Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) is more common in the southwestern United States but does not typically present with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores.

Answer: A",3169
375,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with acute onset facial asymmetry and severe pain, which are classic symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, especially in a young individual with sickle cell disease. Given the clinical presentation and the absence of an intracranial bleed on CT, alteplase is not indicated as it is used for acute ischemic stroke with evidence of a clot. An exchange transfusion is used for managing severe sickle cell crises, not acute stroke. Heparin is used for anticoagulation but is not the first-line treatment for acute stroke. Warfarin is used for long-term anticoagulation and is not appropriate for acute management.

Answer: C",1567
376,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The infant presents with symptoms consistent with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), including recurrent infections (cough, diarrhea), failure to thrive, and oral findings (white plaques on tongue and palate). The absence of weight gain and low growth percentiles further support this. The presence of rales and lymphadenopathy suggests an underlying immune deficiency. The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test is used for diagnosing syphilis, which does not fit the clinical presentation. Karyotyping and CFTR mutation testing are not relevant for SCID. Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes is not indicated for confirming SCID. 

Answer: C",2232
377,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with jaundice, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and elevated liver enzymes (AST 4,702 U/L, ALT 3,551 U/L). These findings are consistent with acute viral hepatitis. Given her recent travel to Sudan, the most likely cause is hepatitis E virus (HEV), as it is endemic in that region. The patient does not have risk factors for hepatitis B (no history of blood products or sexual contact with an infected individual) or hepatitis C (no history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusions). The anti-nuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody tests are negative, ruling out autoimmune hepatitis. The ELISA for HIV is negative, further reducing the likelihood of HIV-related hepatitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is HEV infection, which would be confirmed by a positive Anti-HEV IgM test.

Answer: D",2018
378,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with multiple episodes of nonbilious emesis, undigested food in vomitus, and dark brown emesis, indicating potential obstruction. The progressive severe epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight gain suggest a mass or obstruction in the stomach or proximal small intestine. The presence of a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium and succussion splash are consistent with a mass or obstruction. The family history of colon cancer and the patient's smoking history increase the likelihood of a neoplastic growth. The electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia) and reduced bowel sounds support the idea of an obstruction.

Answer: C",2813
379,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath, intermittent chest pain, and pitting edema, which are classic signs of pulmonary embolism (PE). The combination of low blood pressure during inspiration, jugular venous distention, and pitting edema further supports this diagnosis. These findings are not consistent with pericardial effusion, coronary artery occlusion, or atrial dilation. 

Answer: B",2283
380,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset shortness of breath and cough, along with bipedal edema and JVD, suggesting congestive heart failure (CHF). The lab values show a normal sodium and chloride, slightly low potassium, and a high bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic alkalosis. This combination of symptoms and lab findings is consistent with CHF leading to volume overload and subsequent administration of a loop diuretic like furosemide, which can cause rapid correction of fluid status and improvement in symptoms. Hydrochlorothiazide is not a loop diuretic and would not cause such a rapid response. Renal tubular acidosis types II and IV do not typically present with these specific symptoms and lab findings.

Answer: A",2722
381,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, mild conjunctival pallor, and a peripheral blood smear showing echinocytes. Echinocytes are typically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, a condition where red blood cells are more susceptible to lysis due to a defect in the red blood cell membrane. The rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway, specifically the pathway leading to the synthesis of heme, is ALA synthase. However, the question asks about the biochemical pathway affected by her condition, which is the red blood cell membrane integrity. The enzyme involved in the regulation of the metabolic pathways affecting red blood cell membrane integrity is often regulated by AMP, which inhibits enzymes involved in energy-consuming processes when ATP levels are low. This fits the context of hereditary spherocytosis, where there is a defect in the red blood cell membrane leading to increased fragility and lysis.

Answer: D",2221
382,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior suggests a history of bulimia nervosa. Duloxetine, while effective for various conditions, has been associated with weight gain and can exacerbate binge eating behaviors. Trazodone, bupropion, and citalopram do not have such significant risks related to weight gain or binge eating/purging behaviors.

Answer: A",2110
383,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with recurrent infections (otitis media, bronchiolitis, pneumonia), growth failure, and a specific immunologic presentation (absent thymic shadow, oral and mucosal findings). These findings are consistent with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the definitive treatment for SCID, aiming to replace the defective immune system with a healthy one. The other options (intravenous immune globulin, leucovorin supplementation, and thymic transplantation) do not address the underlying immune defect and are not indicated for SCID.

Answer: A",2076
384,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has multiple hematomas around IV access sites, a healing surgical incision, and signs of right leg swelling, tenderness, and erythema. These findings suggest a bleeding diathesis. The prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are prolonged, indicating a coagulation factor deficiency. The platelet count is low, suggesting a platelet dysfunction or consumption. The symptoms do not suggest autoantibody-mediated platelet activation or excess circulating thrombin. The deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors can explain the prolonged coagulation times and bleeding tendency.

Answer: A",2416
385,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient has chronic hepatitis B infection and elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), indicating a possible hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CT scan showing a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase is consistent with HCC. Overexpression of secretory hepatitis antigen, intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein, and integration of foreign DNA into the host genome are not directly related to the pathogenesis of HCC in this context. A gain of function mutation of a proto-oncogene, such as c-Myc or c-KIT, is more commonly associated with HCC.

Answer: C",2205
386,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, and gum bleeding, indicating possible coagulation dysfunction. The laboratory results show a prolonged PT (13.2s) and aPPT (30s), suggesting a coagulation disorder. The peripheral blood smear shows few platelets but no morphologic abnormalities, ruling out thrombocytopenia due to platelet destruction. Given the clinical presentation and lab findings, the most likely diagnosis is von Willebrand disease, which can cause both bleeding manifestations and a mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the next diagnostic step should be to measure serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity.

Answer: A",1738
387,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a gene defect on chromosome 7 affecting a transmembrane protein, leading to recurrent respiratory infections. This aligns with cystic fibrosis (CF), a condition characterized by mucus accumulation and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Burkholderia species, while significant in CF, are less common than the others listed. Candida typically causes fungal infections rather than bacterial ones. Given the context of chronic bacterial infections, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas are more likely, but Pseudomonas is the most common and significant pathogen in CF patients as they age.

Answer: B",2136
388,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is an 8-week-old male with regurgitation of breastmilk, which is common in infants and often resolves on its own. The mother has already tried reducing the volume of each feed, which has helped reduce the frequency of regurgitation. The patient’s growth has slightly slowed but remains within normal ranges. There are no signs of significant distress or other concerning symptoms. The mother’s older son had a similar issue that resolved around 12 months of age, suggesting a benign course. An abdominal ultrasound or proton pump inhibitor trial is not indicated given the mild nature of the symptoms and lack of other concerning findings. Recommending modification of the mother’s diet is not necessary as the issue appears to be related to feeding technique rather than dietary content.

Answer: C",2579
389,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has weakness in the left lower extremity, loss of vibration and light touch on the left side, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side. These findings suggest a lesion affecting the left side of the spinal cord, specifically a hemisection or left-sided lesion. An anterior cord lesion would affect both sides equally, a posterior cord lesion would primarily affect sensation, and a right cord hemisection would affect the right side. Therefore, the most consistent lesion is a left cord hemisection.

Answer: D",1510
390,Screening,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is an African American man with a family history of prostate cancer, making prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing appropriate. While a digital rectal exam (DRE) is another option, PSA testing is more sensitive for early detection of prostate cancer. An abdominal ultrasound is not typically used for prostate cancer screening. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is more relevant for colorectal cancer screening, but the patient's last colonoscopy was 8 years ago, and there is no indication of recent colorectal issues. Therefore, the most appropriate test is a serum PSA level.

Answer: A",1925
391,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sinus tachycardia, an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiography, and a radial pulse that cannot be palpated during inspiration. These findings suggest pericardial tamponade, a condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardial space compresses the heart, leading to impaired ventricular filling and reduced cardiac output. The inability to palpate the radial pulse during inspiration is a classic sign of pericardial tamponade known as pulsus paradoxus. Given these clinical findings, the most urgent intervention is to relieve the tamponade by draining the pericardial fluid, which can be achieved through pericardiocentesis.

Answer: A",1796
392,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, a dry cough, and wheezing. These symptoms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The spirometry results show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62% and an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, which are characteristic of COPD. The DLCO being decreased is also common in COPD but less specific compared to the other findings. Bronchiectasis would present with more chronic cough and mucus production, which are not prominent in this case. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis would have a history of occupational or environmental exposures and would not typically present with such typical COPD findings. Interstitial lung disease would show different radiographic findings and less wheezing.

Answer: C",1537
393,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The infant has a congenital hernia with loops of intestine protruding from the abdomen. This condition requires immediate attention to prevent complications such as strangulation. The infant's vital signs are stable, but the presence of herniated intestines necessitates prompt intervention. Starting IV fluids can be done later if needed, but the primary concern is the hernia. Wrapping the intestines in a sterile bowel bag is not a standard procedure and could complicate the situation. Immediate transfer to the NICU or for surgery is necessary to address the hernia promptly.

Answer: D",1490
394,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath, along with conjunctival pallor and joint involvement consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Her hemoglobin level is low at 9.2 g/dL, indicating anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL suggests microcytic anemia, which is not typical of iron deficiency anemia given the elevated serum ferritin level (310 ng/mL). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 85 mm/h, suggesting inflammation rather than iron deficiency. 

- Option A (↑ serum transferrin receptors): Not directly related to the given information.
- Option B (↑ transferrin saturation): Not indicated by the lab results.
- Option C (Upregulation of hepcidin): Elevated ferritin suggests adequate iron stores, unlikely upregulation of hepcidin.
- Option D (↑ reticulocyte count): Not supported by the reticulocyte count of 0.4%.

Answer: D",1793
395,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms indicate a need for more aggressive management of his asthma. He has increased use of his albuterol inhaler and nocturnal symptoms, which suggest uncontrolled asthma. Adding a corticosteroid to his regimen would be appropriate. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid that can provide better control than adding another rescue inhaler. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist, which is typically used in combination with a corticosteroid for maintenance therapy, not as a standalone addition. Zileuton is a leukotriene modifier and is not commonly used as first-line therapy for asthma. Therefore, adding fluticasone daily is the most appropriate change to his current asthma treatment regimen.

Answer: B",2433
396,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with pelvic pain, weight loss, increased appetite, chest palpitations, increased diarrhea, and heat intolerance. These symptoms suggest hyperthyroidism. The TSH level of 0.21 mIU/L is very low, confirming hyperthyroidism. Additionally, an ultrasound detects a complex structure in the right ovary. Meigs syndrome involves ascites, pleural effusion, and a benign ovarian tumor, none of which are present here. Jod-Basedow phenomenon is hyperthyroidism due to iodine intake, not related to ovarian tumors. A dermoid cyst is a benign ovarian mass but does not explain the hyperthyroidism. Struma ovarii is a type of ovarian thyroid tissue, causing hyperthyroidism through ectopic thyroid tissue. Given the hyperthyroidism and ovarian mass, struma ovarii fits best.

Answer: D",2030
397,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, pallor, and splenomegaly, along with a low hemoglobin level. His father and aunt also have mild anemia, suggesting a genetic component. Given that the father and aunt are affected, it suggests an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern because:
- The father (XY) would need to pass the mutated gene to his daughters (XX), making them carriers, but not express the disease.
- The aunt (XX) would need to be homozygous for the mutation to express the disease.
Answer: B",1937
398,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.33 (acidosis), a pCO2 of 70 mmHg (elevated), and a HCO3 of 33 mEq/L (metabolic alkalosis). These findings suggest a primary increase in CO2 (metabolic acidosis) with compensatory retention of bicarbonate. This pattern is consistent with a condition that leads to hypoventilation, such as a pulmonary embolus. A panic attack typically does not cause such ABG changes. Mechanical ventilation would normalize ABG values rather than worsen them. Chronic obstructive bronchitis usually presents with chronic symptoms and does not acutely cause such severe acid-base disturbances. 

Answer: C",1598
399,Mechanism,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, visual changes, and a maculopapular rash. These symptoms suggest a systemic reaction rather than a local effect from the fat-burning pills. The sudden onset and the presence of a rash indicate an allergic reaction rather than a direct effect on metabolism or temperature regulation. Bacterial contamination would typically present with more localized symptoms and would not cause a maculopapular rash. The other options do not align with the clinical presentation.

Answer: C",2630
400,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive fatigue, painful swelling of the knee, gum bleeding, petechiae, and abnormal coagulation tests. These findings suggest a bleeding disorder. The arthrocentesis showing bloody synovial fluid further supports a coagulopathy. Lysosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the nucleus do not directly relate to coagulation processes. The extracellular space does not have specific roles in coagulation reactions. Therefore, the defect is most likely in a cellular structure involved in coagulation, which is the endoplasmic reticulum, specifically the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as it is involved in protein synthesis and modification, including coagulation factors.

Answer: B",1678
401,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient had unprotected intercourse and is not pregnant, as indicated by the negative urine pregnancy test. She desires contraception to avoid pregnancy in the future. The options include methods of emergency contraception or long-term contraception. Ulipristal acetate and mifepristone are used for early abortion rather than emergency contraception. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-acting contraceptive but not suitable for immediate use. The copper-containing intra-uterine device (IUD) is an effective form of emergency contraception when inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse.

Answer: A",1686
402,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include an acute onset rash with targetoid lesions and a vesicular center, fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills. These symptoms are consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, specifically Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Valproate is known to cause SJS/TEN, while the other options (lamotrigine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, and paroxetine) do not have this adverse effect profile. Lithium can cause rashes but not typically targetoid lesions with a vesicular center.

Answer: B",2010
403,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include mild episodic abdominal pain in the epigastrium and back, occurring every 1–2 months and lasting a few hours. These symptoms do not align with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which typically presents with projectile vomiting without bile and is more common in newborns. Biliary cysts are not commonly associated with abdominal pain in the epigastrium and back. Intestinal malrotation can present with acute onset of severe pain and vomiting, often requiring urgent surgical intervention, which does not match the patient's chronic, episodic symptoms. Pancreas divisum can cause abdominal pain, especially in association with acute or chronic pancreatitis, but it is less likely given the absence of other symptoms like fever, weight loss, or jaundice. 

Answer: D",1790
404,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a cleft palate and congenital heart defects including pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and overriding aorta, indicating a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). TOF is characterized by a boot-shaped heart and a catlike cry due to hypoxia-induced episodes of cyanosis. Hypocalcemia typically causes seizures but is not associated with TOF. Hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies is not related to the cardiac defects. Elevated phenylalanine levels suggest phenylketonuria, which is unrelated to the presented cardiac anomalies.

Answer: B",1746
405,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis. This leads to decreased mevalonate production, which is a precursor for cholesterol biosynthesis. Acetoacetyl-CoA is involved in ketone body synthesis but not directly affected by atorvastatin. Diacylglycerol (diglyceride) levels are not directly impacted by statin use. HDL cholesterol may increase slightly over time with statin therapy but is not immediately reduced.
Answer: A",1813
406,Mechanism,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presented with acute onset of seizures and hallucinations, suggesting a neurological infection. He had been on a camping trip where he might have been exposed to bats, indicating a zoonotic source. The histology of the brain would show characteristic changes consistent with a viral infection. Given the context of bat exposure and the symptoms, the most likely pathogen is a hantavirus, specifically Puumala virus, which can cause HFRS. Puumala virus infects vascular endothelial cells, which express ICAM-1. Therefore, ICAM-1 is targeted by the virus.

Answer: C",2182
407,Mechanism,False,C,B,"Reasoning: Niacin at high doses can cause flushing, itching, and skin rash due to mast cell degranulation. Aspirin can inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The side effect being avoided is not related to bile deposition, prostaglandin release, or T-cell activation. Therefore, the mechanism is mast cell degranulation.

Answer: C",1616
408,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a positive Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA test, indicating active HCV infection. The liver biopsy shows mononuclear infiltrates and periportal hepatocyte necrosis, consistent with chronic hepatitis C. The most appropriate next step in management for HCV infection is antiviral therapy. Among the options, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (Harvoni) is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen commonly used for HCV genotype 1 infections.

Answer: A",2899
409,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with tingling in her feet, poor balance, conjunctival pallor, ataxic gait, and macrocytic anemia. These symptoms suggest pernicious anemia, which is caused by autoimmune destruction of parietal cells leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. The histological findings of atrophic changes in the gastric body and fundus support this diagnosis. Islet cell cytoplasm, deamidated gliadin peptide, and smooth muscle are not typically targeted in this context.

Answer: C",1746
410,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include frequent, large volume urination and increased thirst, which are consistent with diabetes insipidus. Given her history of bipolar disorder treated with lithium, we need to consider the effect of lithium on water balance. Lithium can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by impairing the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, leading to increased urine osmolality relative to serum osmolality. The serum osmolality of 425 mOsm/kg is very high, indicating severe dehydration, while the urine osmolality of 176 mOsm/kg is lower than expected for a normally functioning ADH system. This pattern is characteristic of ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts.

Answer: C",1700
411,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with pruritic lesions over her buttocks, which are intermittent and worsening. She also has a history of iron deficiency and mild diarrhea, previously attributed to lactose intolerance. An elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer suggests possible celiac disease. However, the presence of pruritic lesions does not align with Crohn's disease, common variable immune deficiency, or Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Celiac disease is strongly indicated by the elevated tissue transglutaminase titer and the intermittent symptoms.

Answer: B",1975
412,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with lower back pain, fever, chills, and costovertebral angle tenderness, indicating possible pyelonephritis. The elevated white blood cell count (19,000/mm³) and nitrite positivity in the urine suggest a bacterial infection. The high leukocyte casts and WBC count in the urine confirm a significant urinary tract infection. Given the severity of symptoms and the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness, inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics is necessary to ensure adequate coverage and monitoring.

Answer: A",3360
413,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has excessive drainage output and is difficult to arouse, indicating possible hypovolemia and dehydration. The high serum sodium (154 mEq/L) suggests hypernatremia, which can cause confusion and altered mental status. Given the patient's dry skin and mucous membranes, fluid replacement is necessary. 

Option A (0.9% saline IV) would help correct the volume deficit but does not address the hypernatremia directly.
Option B (5% dextrose IV) is not indicated as there is no evidence of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
Option C (5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV) is not typically used for this scenario.
Option D (oral free water replacement) is not feasible given the patient's condition and need for rapid correction.

Answer: C",1980
414,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness, which started after returning from a trip to India. She had watery stools and mild nausea after eating in-flight. These symptoms are consistent with a traveler's diarrhea. The presence of watery stools and hyperactive bowel sounds suggest a non-invasive pathogen. 

- **Giardia intestinalis**: Typically causes chronic, non-watery diarrhea and is not associated with acute watery diarrhea.
- **Shigella species**: Causes bloody diarrhea and is less likely given the absence of blood in the stool.
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Can cause food poisoning with nausea and vomiting but typically does not cause watery diarrhea.
- **Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)**: Commonly causes acute watery diarrhea and is a leading cause of traveler's diarrhea.

Answer: D",2424
415,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It depends on factors such as the sample size, effect size, and the significance level. In this case, the power of the test can be calculated using the formula for power, which involves the sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate), and the prevalence of the disease.

- Option A is incorrect because the statistical power can change with repeated studies due to variations in sample characteristics.
- Option B is incorrect; the power of the test can be calculated as follows: Sensitivity = 45/50 = 0.9, Specificity = 35/50 = 0.7. Power is not directly given by these values but can be estimated using the formula for power, which involves the effect size and sample size. Given the data, the power is not 0.8.
- Option C is correct; increasing the specificity would reduce the number of false positives, thereby increasing the overall accuracy and potentially the power of the test.
- Option D is incorrect; decreasing the sensitivity would increase the number of false negatives, reducing the overall accuracy and likely decreasing the power of the test.

Answer: C",1616
416,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient has recurrent infections including meningitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting a defect in the innate immune system. The Gram-positive diplococci on vaginal swab and growth on Thayer-Martin agar suggest Neisseria species, which are typically associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Neisseria meningitidis. However, given the patient's history of meningitis and previous infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most likely cause is a defect in the complement system, specifically C3, which is crucial for the alternative complement pathway. This defect would explain the recurrent infections.

Answer: D",1548
417,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient developed perioral numbness, paresthesia, and latent tetany after a total thyroidectomy. These symptoms are consistent with hypocalcemia. The patient's serum calcium level is low at 6.7 mg/dL, which supports this diagnosis. 

- **Option A**: Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands is a common cause of hypoparathyroidism and resultant hypocalcemia, leading to these symptoms.
- **Option B**: DiGeorge syndrome is less likely because it typically presents with congenital heart defects, immunodeficiency, and other systemic issues, not isolated hypocalcemia.
- **Option C**: Chronic hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia but is less common than hypoparathyroidism as a cause of these symptoms.
- **Option D**: Hungry bone syndrome occurs post-thyroidectomy but usually presents with hypercalcemia due to rapid bone resorption, not hypocalcemia.

Answer: A",2719
418,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the fingernails, which are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The low mean corpuscular volume (76 μm3) and elevated red cell distribution width (18%) support this diagnosis. Other potential causes like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency have not been mentioned, and there is no indication for blood transfusions or stem cell transplantation. Methylphenidate is used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is iron supplementation.

Answer: C",1921
419,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with painful enlarging bruises, skin ulceration, purpura, and hemorrhagic bullae, which are consistent with a bleeding disorder. Given that he was recently started on warfarin, he may be experiencing warfarin-induced coagulopathy with bleeding (WICB), a complication of warfarin therapy. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor and can rapidly reverse the effects of warfarin, making it the most appropriate treatment in this scenario. Hyperbaric oxygen, protein C concentrate, and tranexamic acid do not directly address the underlying coagulopathy caused by warfarin.

Answer: C",2239
420,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats, which is characteristic of Fragile X syndrome. Common physical findings in Fragile X syndrome include a long face, large everted ears, and macroorchidism in males. The other options (frontal balding and cataracts, almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth, thin upper lip and receding chin) are not typically associated with CGG repeat expansions.

Answer: B",1541
421,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with signs of decompensated heart failure, including hypotension, prominent neck vein distention, S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and bilateral edema. A decreased ejection fraction indicates significant heart failure. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can help manage fluid overload. Nesiritide is a potent vasodilator that can quickly improve cardiac output and reduce congestion. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can reduce heart rate and workload. Digoxin is a positive inotropic agent often used to enhance cardiac contractility. However, in decompensated heart failure, the use of positive inotropic agents like digoxin can be risky as they can lead to arrhythmias and further compromise cardiac function. Therefore, digoxin should be avoided in this setting.
Answer: D",1280
422,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has progressive dyspnea, bilateral rales, and hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mm Hg). She also has an S3 gallop and S2 accentuation, suggesting heart failure. The absence of leg edema and neurological examination within normal limits rules out pulmonary embolism. Opioid use can depress the respiratory center, leading to hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis, but the PaCO2 is within normal range (30 mm Hg). Alveolar fibrosis would not explain the sudden onset of symptoms and bilateral rales. Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli is less likely given the absence of other signs like cyanosis or specific lung findings. 

Answer: C",2499
423,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of generalized seizures, recent impetigo treatment, and a positive cocaine use. The laboratory findings show mild liver enzyme elevation (AST and ALT) and proteinuria. The presence of protein in the urine and the recent history of impetigo suggest an immune response to a streptococcal infection, as impetigo is often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. This can lead to an immune-mediated response affecting the kidneys and liver.

Answer: B",2608
424,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Barrett's esophagus involves metaplastic changes in the lower esophagus where the stratified squamous epithelium is replaced by simple columnar epithelium. Paneth cells are typically found in the intestinal glands of the small intestine, not in the esophagus. Esophageal varices are more commonly associated with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa could indicate other conditions such as esophagitis rather than Barrett's esophagus.

Answer: C",1751
425,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 16-year-old with mental retardation who cannot understand the consequences of sexual intercourse. Compulsory sterilization without the patient's informed consent violates the ethical principle of autonomy. Additionally, there is no immediate risk of pregnancy given the patient's cognitive limitations. Therefore, scheduling the procedure now would be unethical.

Answer: C",2146
426,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, and black hemorrhagic eschars, which are characteristic of plague caused by *Yersinia pestis*. The virulence factor of *Yersinia pestis* is known to inhibit phagocytosis, which helps the bacteria evade the immune system and spread. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation.

Answer: B",2146
427,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that works by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for breaking down carbohydrates in the small intestine. When these enzymes are inhibited, the digestion of carbohydrates is slowed, leading to a more gradual rise in blood glucose levels. This mechanism of action specifically targets glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates. Therefore, when the patient takes miglitol, the glycosidic bonds in the carbohydrates will no longer be cleaved.

Answer: B",1110
428,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with burning pain, swelling, and blisters on the left index finger, which are more consistent with a dermatological condition such as herpes zoster (shingles) rather than a bacterial infection or poison oak exposure. The presence of multiple vesicles and erythema is characteristic of shingles caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus. Smoking cessation is important for overall health but not a direct treatment for the current condition. Washing thoroughly is not sufficient for treating the condition. Oral antibiotics like cephalexin are used for bacterial infections, not viral ones. Therefore, oral acyclovir, an antiviral medication, is the most appropriate next step.

Answer: A",2486
429,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn, along with a hiatal hernia and GERD. Despite previous treatments, these symptoms persist. Lifestyle modifications and antacid therapy are initial steps but often insufficient for severe cases. Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) might help, but given the persistent symptoms and structural abnormality, surgical intervention is warranted. 

Answer: D",2213
430,Septicemia,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include hemodynamic instability, fever, and a spreading redness from a foot injury, which suggests a severe bacterial infection. The Gram stain showed gram-negative bacilli, indicating a likely sepsis. The patient's blood pressure is low (84/46 mmHg), and the mean arterial pressure is 59 mmHg, which is indicative of shock. The skin is described as warm, which rules out hypovolemic, neurogenic, and obstructive shock, where the skin is typically cold. Therefore, the shock is most consistent with distributive shock, which is commonly seen in sepsis.

Answer: A",2423
431,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with an inability to urinate, which could indicate neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Additionally, she has a history of sexual abuse and recent facial pain that worsens with specific activities, suggesting possible psychological factors. The leftward gaze abnormality indicates a possible cranial nerve palsy, likely due to a pseudotumor or other non-organic cause given the patient's history and recent symptom resolution. Given the patient's psychological background and the need to rule out non-organic causes, a domestic abuse screening and exploring life stressors is the best initial step. A head CT or MRI would be more appropriate if there were concerning neurological signs or if a structural lesion was suspected, but the primary concern here is the psychological and emotional state of the patient.

Answer: D",2842
432,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with confusion, agitation, memory impairment, and nystagmus, which are classic symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. This condition is typically caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, especially in chronic alcohol users. Immediate treatment involves thiamine supplementation to prevent further neurological damage. Naltrexone is used for alcohol dependence but not as an initial treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy. Vitamin B12 and glucose are not indicated for this specific condition.

Answer: A",1966
433,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include a yellow-green, malodorous vaginal discharge, pelvic and abdominal pain, and cervical motion tenderness. These symptoms are more consistent with trichomoniasis caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis*, which typically presents with a frothy, greenish-yellow, malodorous discharge and cervical inflammation. The presence of motile organisms in the wet mount supports this diagnosis. *Ureaplasma urealyticum* and *Enterobius vermicularis* do not cause such a discharge, and *Chlamydia trachomatis* typically causes a clearer, mucoid discharge without the characteristic motile organisms seen in trichomoniasis.

Answer: C",1833
434,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include forgetfulness, getting lost, social withdrawal, and difficulty with memory. These are classic signs of Alzheimer's disease, characterized by a decline in cognitive function and memory. The patient's indifference to his memory lapses and orientation only to person further support this diagnosis. GABA, while important for inhibitory signaling, is not typically targeted in Alzheimer's treatment. Acetylcholine and dopamine are involved in cognitive function, but acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (like donepezil) and dopamine agonists are not first-line treatments. Glutamate is involved in excitatory signaling and is not primarily targeted in Alzheimer's management. Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy would target acetylcholine, which is deficient in Alzheimer's disease.

Answer: B",2409
435,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with acute-onset shortness of breath, diffuse wheezes, and contracted pupils. These symptoms suggest an anaphylactic reaction rather than asthma or other respiratory conditions. Succinylcholine (option A) is used for muscle relaxation and intubation, not for treating anaphylaxis. Atropine and pralidoxime (option C) are used for organophosphate poisoning, not for anaphylaxis. Inhaled albuterol (option D) is used for bronchodilation in asthma but is not effective for anaphylaxis. Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen (option B) are appropriate for managing anaphylaxis by reducing bronchoconstriction and providing oxygen support.

Answer: B",1658
436,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient shows signs of disproportionate growth with frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities, while the axial skeleton appears normal. This suggests a disruption in the development of the facial bones and skull, which aligns with intramembranous ossification. Endochondral ossification primarily affects the axial skeleton, so it is less likely given the normal axial skeleton. Osteoblast maturation and type I collagen production are more general processes involved in bone formation but do not specifically explain the described craniofacial and limb abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely disrupted process is intramembranous ossification.

Answer: A",1811
437,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a firm, nontender mass in the breast, and mammography shows an irregular calcified mass. These findings are consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma. Among the given options, HER2 is a well-known proto-oncogene associated with breast cancer and often shows overexpression in certain types of breast cancer. BCR-ABL is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BRCA-2 mutations are linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and BCL-2 is involved in apoptosis but not specifically overexpressed in breast cancer. Therefore, the most likely gene showing overexpression in this patient's cancer cells is HER2.

Answer: A",1493
438,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include constipation, straining during bowel movements, and fatigue. These symptoms suggest a problem with bowel motility rather than kidney function or electrolyte transport. Macrogol (PEG) acts as a laxative by increasing water content in the intestines, thus facilitating bowel movements. None of the other options (angiotensin-II receptors, ACE, Na+/Cl- cotransporter, or Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters) are directly involved in bowel motility. Therefore, the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is not among the given options.

Answer: A",2041
439,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a circular, itchy rash consistent with a ringworm infection (tinea). The KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae, which is characteristic of a fungal infection. Itraconazole and griseofulvin are antifungals commonly used for treating tinea infections. Topical clindamycin is an antibiotic and would not be effective against a fungal infection. Doxycycline is an antibiotic and would be more appropriate for bacterial infections rather than fungal infections. Therefore, the next best step is to prescribe an antifungal medication.

Answer: A",2233
440,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient is a 12-year-old boy with spontaneous nasal bleeding from one nostril without a history of similar episodes or other systemic conditions. The bleeding is not controlled by manual compression. Given the absence of other symptoms or risk factors, the most likely cause is a localized lesion such as a polyp or tumor. Initial therapy should aim to stop the bleeding while considering further diagnostic steps if necessary. 

- Option A (Anterior packing and topical antibiotics): This is typically used for more severe cases where other methods fail, but it's not the first-line approach.
- Option B (Oxymetazoline nasal spray): This decongests the nasal passages but does not address the source of bleeding.
- Option C (Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril): Epinephrine can constrict blood vessels and help stop bleeding, making it a suitable initial therapy.
- Option D (Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated): This is not effective for controlling the bleeding in this case.

Answer: C",1899
441,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with tender neck, granulomatous inflammation, and multinucleate giant cells, which are indicative of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and can involve various organs, including the thyroid. Iodine deficiency typically leads to goiter and hypothyroidism without the granulomatous inflammation seen here. A throglossal duct cyst would not cause systemic symptoms like lethargy and would not present with granulomatous inflammation. Chronic renal disease does not typically cause granulomatous inflammation in the thyroid. Therefore, the most likely cause is an infection leading to granulomatous inflammation, which can mimic sarcoidosis.

Answer: C",2106
442,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is accusing his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict while also expressing agitation and anger. This behavior suggests that the patient is projecting his own feelings of frustration and anger onto someone else. He is not denying the issue, nor is he displacing his emotions onto an inanimate object or regression to a younger state of mind. Projection fits the scenario where the patient attributes his own unacceptable thoughts and feelings to someone else.
Answer: C",1916
443,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include a severe fever, maculopapular rash, swollen and painful ankles, and other systemic symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and headaches. These symptoms are consistent with Leishmania major infection, which causes zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis and can present with fever, rash, and painful swelling of the extremities. Babesia and Dengue viruses do not typically cause ankle swelling or painful wrists and fingers. Chikungunya primarily causes joint pain but does not commonly cause the extensive rash and swelling seen here. 

Answer: D",2190
444,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing severe hypotension, tachycardia, and metabolic derangements (elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate), indicating significant hemodynamic instability and potential liver failure. Given these findings, the priority should be to stabilize the patient's condition rather than addressing his psychological state immediately. Consulting an ethics committee or obtaining a judge's order for resuscitation is not the immediate action needed. Instead, ensuring appropriate medical intervention is crucial.

Answer: C",2445
445,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has swelling in the right leg without pain, which suggests a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rather than a pulmonary embolism given the absence of pleuritic chest pain or other respiratory symptoms. The absence of erythema and pitting edema reduces the likelihood of cellulitis. Compression ultrasonography is the gold standard for diagnosing DVT and can detect clots directly. CT pulmonary angiography is more appropriate for diagnosing pulmonary embolism, which is less likely given the clinical presentation. D-dimer testing is a screening tool but not definitive, and blood cultures are not indicated without signs of infection.

Answer: B",1970
446,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The drug described is a class I anti-arrhythmic sodium channel blocker that also blocks potassium channels, prolonging the action potential duration. Common drugs fitting this description include quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. These drugs can cause side effects such as anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision) and alpha-adrenergic blockade (hypotension, dizziness). High doses can lead to more severe side effects including headache, tinnitus, and hypotension. Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits are not typical side effects of these drugs. Pedal edema and flushing are more associated with other classes of drugs like calcium channel blockers. Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity are not common side effects of class I anti-arrhythmics.

Answer: A",1856
447,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include recurrent bloody vomiting, alcohol abuse, and signs of liver dysfunction such as spider angiomas and a distended abdomen. These findings suggest cirrhosis and portal hypertension. In this context, the patient is likely to have hypovolemic shock due to gastrointestinal bleeding, which would lead to decreased systemic vascular resistance to maintain adequate perfusion. The other options (fractional tissue oxygen extraction, carotid baroreceptor firing activity, and cardiac inotropy) are less directly related to the primary issue of hypovolemic shock and portal hypertension.

Answer: A",2631
448,Treatment,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a small, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.1 cm. Given that the aneurysm is not ruptured and is relatively small, elective repair is appropriate. Immediate emergency repair is indicated only for larger aneurysms or those that are rapidly growing or symptomatic. Clinical surveillance alone is insufficient given the risk of rupture. Endovascular repair is a viable option but not specified as the best course without additional information on the patient's overall condition and aneurysm characteristics.

Answer: B",3657
449,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient underwent a partial thyroidectomy due to an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During the surgery, the inferior thyroid arteries were ligated close to the poles of the thyroid gland. Two weeks later, the patient presented with hoarseness. Given the location of the ligation near the poles of the thyroid gland, it is likely that the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which runs closely to the thyroid gland, was injured during the procedure. The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, and damage to it can result in hoarseness or loss of voice.

Answer: B",1432
450,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is Tanner stage 1, indicating no signs of puberty, and has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell, suggesting congenital anosmia. This combination points towards Kallmann syndrome, which is characterized by isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency and anosmia. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well.

Answer: B",1896
451,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: Cilostazol is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor that works by blocking the P2Y12 receptor, which prevents the activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors and reduces platelet aggregation. This mechanism aligns with the description of cilostazol as an ADP receptor inhibitor.

Answer: C",1620
452,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's recent travel to South America and the presence of hantavirus-like symptoms (fever, malaise, chest pain, dry cough, and bilateral lung infiltrates) suggest hantavirus infection. Hantaviruses are known to be carried by rodents and can cause pulmonary syndrome. The deep noise in the lung bases and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph are consistent with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The other options (cultured on charcoal and yeast, D-glutamate capsule, and polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule) do not match the characteristics of hantaviruses.

Answer: None of the given options directly describe hantaviruses, but the context strongly suggests hantavirus infection. 

Answer: None",1891
453,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, along with petechiae and a systolic murmur. These symptoms suggest a systemic infection possibly involving the lungs and potentially sepsis. The presence of petechiae could indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is commonly associated with invasive fungal infections like Aspergillus fumigatus. Additionally, the patient's immunocompromised state due to smoking and alcohol use, along with the presence of small scars, suggests a compromised immune system. 

Eliminating options:
- Streptococci viridans and Staphylococcus epidermidis are less likely given the systemic symptoms and the presence of petechiae.
- Staphylococcus aureus could cause localized infections but not the systemic symptoms described.

Answer: C",2078
454,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with episodic headaches, palpitations, sweating, and pallor, which are classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that produce catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating. The histology slide (figure A) would likely show chromaffin cells, which are responsible for producing catecholamines. Given the context, the cells in the slide are most likely from the adrenal medulla.

Answer: C",1548
455,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, indicating involvement of the visual pathways. The visual fields being affected suggest a lesion in the occipital lobe, specifically the posterior cerebral artery territory, as it supplies the occipital lobe where visual processing occurs. The internal carotid artery and its branches supply the anterior part of the brain, including the anterior cerebral artery territory, which does not match the described visual field loss. The basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery territory are more consistent with the presentation. However, the posterior cerebral artery specifically supplies the occipital lobe, making it the most likely source of the lesion.

Answer: C",2177
456,Jaundice,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The infant is three days old, born vaginally, and has yellow skin. The mother reports poor latch during breastfeeding and the baby is making stools 2 times per day. Breast milk jaundice typically appears around 4 days of age and can last up to 3 weeks. Breastfeeding jaundice is less common and usually resolves within a few days. Sepsis would present with more systemic symptoms like fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which are not mentioned. Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia is common in newborns but does not typically cause poor latch or poor feeding. Therefore, the most likely etiology is breast milk jaundice.

Answer: A",3138
457,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with black, tarry stools (melena), progressive confusion, and neurological findings such as asterixis, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. The liver function tests show elevated transaminases and bilirubin, consistent with liver cirrhosis. 

- Option A: Ammonia levels can be elevated in hepatic encephalopathy, but they are not the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis. Blood ammonia levels are not always elevated and other tests like EEG are more definitive.
- Option B: Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of liver cirrhosis and can occur without cirrhosis in rare cases, making it not a diagnosis of exclusion.
- Option C: While hepatic encephalopathy is more common in patients with cirrhosis, it can occur in other liver diseases or conditions that impair liver function.
- Option D: EEG typically does not show focal localizing abnormalities in hepatic encephalopathy; it usually shows diffuse slowing.

Answer: A",2691
458,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's heart rate increased from 70/min to 130/min and blood pressure rose from 114/74 mm Hg to 145/75 mm Hg immediately after stopping the run. This indicates a sudden increase in both heart rate and blood pressure, which is consistent with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The baroreceptor reflex would typically cause a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure when blood pressure rises, which does not match the observed changes. Vagal nuclei activation would lead to a decrease in heart rate, not an increase. Vasopressin release primarily affects blood pressure through vasoconstriction but does not directly explain the rapid increase in heart rate.

Answer: C",2116
459,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include severe, acute hip and knee pain, limited range of motion, and displacement of the femoral head on imaging, which is characteristic of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Given the displacement of the femoral head, surgical intervention is necessary to stabilize the joint and prevent further displacement. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections and conservative measures like a Pavlik harness are not indicated for SCFE. Reassessing in 3 months would be too late given the risk of progressive displacement and potential avascular necrosis.

Answer: D",2526
460,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with gynecomastia and a testicular mass, which are common in Klinefelter syndrome due to hormonal imbalances. The patient's history of alcohol use and weight gain could suggest obesity, but the specific symptoms of gynecomastia and testicular mass are more indicative of Klinefelter syndrome. Trauma to the testis would typically cause pain and swelling rather than gynecomastia. A Leydig cell tumor can cause gynecomastia but is less common compared to Klinefelter syndrome in this context.

Answer: C",2278
461,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's erectile dysfunction (ED) started after becoming sexually active with a new girlfriend, suggesting psychological factors may be contributing. His history of depression and recent stress also support a psychological etiology. No physical abnormalities were found on examination, and nocturnal penile tumescence testing is not indicated without suspicion of organic ED. Switching antidepressants to bupropion might help, but psychotherapy can address both the psychological aspects and the depression. Penile prosthesis insertion is too invasive for a likely non-organic cause.

Answer: A",2025
462,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with acute bacterial sinusitis, including facial tenderness, purulent nasal discharge, and bilateral expiratory wheezing. Given the presence of purulent mucus and facial tenderness, a bacterial etiology is likely. The patient's history of intermittent asthma and current symptoms suggest a need for both antibiotic coverage and management of airway inflammation. 

- **Amoxicillin** is appropriate for many bacterial infections but may not cover atypical bacteria.
- **Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid** provides broader coverage against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which might be necessary if there is concern about resistant strains.
- **Clindamycin** is effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain Gram-positive organisms but is not typically the first-line antibiotic for sinusitis.
- **Levofloxacin** is a broad-spectrum antibiotic but is generally reserved for more severe or resistant infections due to its potential side effects.

Given the patient's symptoms and the need for broad coverage, **Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid** is the best choice to cover a range of potential pathogens.

Answer: B",2251
463,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) with increased symptoms including cough, breathing difficulty, and increased expectoration. His current medications are inhaled salmeterol and inhaled fluticasone propionate, which are commonly used for COPD management. Given his history and symptoms, we need a medication that can reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

- **Oral prednisone** (Option A): While corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and improve symptoms, they are typically used for short-term management of exacerbations rather than long-term prevention.
- **Supplemental oxygen** (Option B): This can help maintain adequate oxygen levels but does not address the underlying inflammatory processes contributing to exacerbations.
- **Nebulized N-acetylcysteine** (Option D): This is primarily used to thin mucus and improve clearance but does not have significant anti-inflammatory effects for preventing exacerbations.
- **Montelukast** (Option C): This leukotriene receptor antagonist reduces airway inflammation and can prevent exacerbations in patients with COPD, especially those with coexisting asthma or allergic rhinitis.

Answer: C",2566
464,Spontaneous Abortion,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of substance abuse, anxiety, and the presentation of extreme emotional reactions, including anger, aggression, and suicidal ideation (self-harming behaviors) are consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The patient's initial gratitude followed by anger and aggression, along with the presence of new lacerations, are classic signs of BPD. There is no indication of antisocial behavior or post-traumatic stress disorder in this scenario. The normal grief response typically does not involve such extreme and volatile emotional outbursts.

Answer: B",2026
465,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain, which are classic symptoms of renal colic, often seen in acute nephrolithiasis. However, the use of high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks is a risk factor for papillary necrosis, especially given the presence of proteinuria. Diffuse cortical necrosis and chronic pyelonephritis are less likely given the acute presentation and the absence of palpable flank masses and other signs of infection. 

Answer: C",2068
466,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include bilateral knee pain, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness, which are consistent with excess weight and obesity. His BMI of 41 kg/m2 indicates severe obesity, which can lead to osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal issues. The lack of tenderness and erythema, along with the presence of crepitus, suggests mechanical stress rather than an infection or malignancy. The family history of rheumatoid arthritis and the use of metformin do not directly explain the current symptoms. Therefore, the underlying cause of the patient’s pain and other complaints is most likely due to his excess weight.

Answer: B",1908
467,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of myasthenia gravis, including shortness of breath, double vision, and generalized muscle weakness. The anterior mediastinal mass suggests a thymoma, which is often associated with myasthenia gravis. The photomicrograph of the thymus tissue would show thymic epithelial cells and thymocytes. Thymocytes are involved in T-cell development, specifically in the process of negative selection to prevent autoimmunity. B-cell maturation and V(D)J recombination occur in the bone marrow, not the thymus. Thymocyte formation is a key process in the thymus. Therefore, the immunologic process occurring in the thymus is negative selection.

Answer: D",1175
468,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with drowsiness, lethargy, and pinpoint pupils, indicating opioid overdose. The drug administered would counteract these effects. Option A (μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist) is incorrect because it would not specifically target the opioid receptors. Option B (μ receptor agonist) would exacerbate the overdose. Option C (κ receptor agonist and μ receptor antagonist) is unlikely as κ agonists do not typically reverse opioid effects. Option D (μ receptor partial agonist and κ receptor agonist) could potentially reverse the effects but is less specific than a pure μ receptor antagonist. The most effective and specific treatment for opioid overdose is a μ receptor antagonist like naloxone.

Answer: D",2283
469,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain, which are nonspecific but could be related to respiratory or systemic conditions. Notably, she returned from a vacation to Arizona, suggesting a possible exposure to a local pathogen. The presence of ciliary injection and photophobia in the left eye is less relevant to the primary symptoms. 

- Sarcoidosis typically presents with bilateral hilar adenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, and systemic symptoms like fatigue, but no specific diagnostic features are mentioned here.
- Pulmonary tuberculosis would present with more classic symptoms like persistent cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss, which are not prominent in this case.
- Hodgkin's lymphoma would present with enlarged lymph nodes, which are not noted in this case.
- Histoplasmosis is common in areas with high levels of bird or bat droppings, such as Arizona, and can present with respiratory symptoms and systemic manifestations like malaise and joint pain.

Answer: D",2065
470,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include dysphagia for both solids and liquids, which suggests involvement of the swallowing mechanism. The presence of a small outpouching in the posterior neck during the swallowing study is indicative of a hiatal hernia or similar condition. The vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the upper esophageal sphincter and is crucial for the coordination of swallowing. Given the patient's symptoms and the anatomical finding, the vagus nerve (CN X) is most likely involved.

Answer: A",2440
471,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid, along with pain during swallowing. These symptoms suggest a rapidly growing, non-vascularized mass, which is more consistent with anaplastic carcinoma rather than medullary carcinoma, which typically presents with a more gradual onset and less tenderness. Reidel thyroiditis and silent thyroiditis do not present with such acute symptoms or tenderness. The low radioactive iodine uptake on the radionuclide scan is also more indicative of anaplastic carcinoma, as medullary carcinoma usually shows increased uptake.

Answer: A",2093
472,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The urinary concentration of sodium decreases and pH decreases while urinary potassium increases. This indicates that the compound X is affecting the distal convoluted tubule, where sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion occur. Among the options, only hydrochlorothiazide (Option B) is known to act on the distal convoluted tubule and cause these specific changes in renal function.

Answer: B",1377
473,Herpesviridae,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with painful mouth/gums, vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, and ulceration. These symptoms are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, along with cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy, are classic findings in HSV infection. CMV typically causes mononucleosis-like symptoms but does not present with vesicular lesions. HIV can cause oral ulcers but is not typically associated with vesicular lesions in the absence of immunosuppression. HSV-1 is more commonly associated with oral lesions, while HSV-2 is more often associated with genital lesions. Given the location of the lesions, HSV-1 is the most likely causative organism.

Answer: C",1660
474,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a clear advance directive stating no resuscitation. The wife's demands should not override the patient's documented preferences. Consulting a judge or the ethics committee is unnecessary if the advance directive is valid and clearly states the patient's wishes.

Answer: B",2313
475,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with retrosternal chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggesting possible ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). The ECG would be crucial to confirm the rhythm. Intravenous amiodarone and synchronized cardioversion are used for VT/VF. Esmolol can slow the heart rate but is not typically used for conversion. A coronary angiogram is more appropriate if there is suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but the patient’s hemodynamic instability suggests a need for immediate rhythm control. 

Answer: D",2177
476,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and increased osmotic fragility. These findings are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis, where red blood cells are more fragile and prone to hemolysis. The osmotic fragility test confirms this. Given the context of hereditary spherocytosis, the blood smear would show spherocytes, which are spherical red blood cells.

Answer: C",1970
477,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include a tingling sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm, which suggests a potential nerve compression. Given the location of the symptoms and the fact that they started after lifting heavy weights, it is likely related to a nerve in the elbow region rather than the neck. The ulnar nerve, which runs along the medial side of the elbow, is less likely given the lateral distribution of symptoms. The radial nerve, which provides sensation to the lateral forearm and innervates the extensor muscles of the wrist and hand, fits the description well. Loss of sensation on the lateral side of the forearm and weakness in wrist extension are classic signs of radial nerve compression, known as radial tunnel syndrome.

Answer: D",1939
478,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. Serologic tests reveal positive Anti-HBsAg (indicating past or current hepatitis B infection) and Anti-HAV IgM (indicating recent hepatitis A virus infection). Given these findings, the most likely cause of her symptoms is a recent hepatitis A infection. Neither needlestick, unprotected sex, nor shellfish consumption are directly associated with these specific serologic test results. An acetaminophen overdose typically causes different symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and liver toxicity without the specific serologic markers seen here.

Answer: C",1581
479,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset severe leg pain, pallor, and coolness, along with a weaker popliteal pulse. These symptoms are indicative of acute limb ischemia. Among the given options, arterial emboli is the most common cause of acute limb ischemia, leading to sudden onset symptoms and reduced blood flow. Vasculitis and hyperhomocysteinemia are less likely to cause such sudden and specific symptoms. Arterial trauma would typically present with more localized injury signs rather than generalized limb ischemia.

Answer: C",1807
480,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient is 17 years old and has not undergone puberty, indicating delayed puberty. She has undeveloped breasts and is in Tanner I stage of development, which aligns with delayed puberty. There are no symptoms or findings suggesting hypokalemia, aromatase enzyme deficiency, or hypercortisolism. An XY karyotype would be expected in a male, not a female with delayed puberty. Therefore, the most likely finding is delayed puberty itself, which is already described.

Answer: C",1540
481,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Raising the hemoglobin A1c cut-off from 6.5% to 7.0% means that more individuals will need to have their A1c levels above 7.0% to be diagnosed with diabetes. This change will result in fewer people being diagnosed with diabetes (decreasing true positive results) and more people being correctly identified as not having diabetes (increasing true negative results). However, the question specifically asks about the impact on false negative and false positive results. Since the cut-off is raised, fewer individuals will be diagnosed with diabetes, thus increasing the number of false negative results (people who actually have diabetes but are not diagnosed).

Answer: A",1657
482,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Hydroxyurea is known to increase the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF), which helps reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises by stabilizing the adult hemoglobin (HgbA). It does not decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, nor does it decrease the levels of HgbS directly; rather, it shifts the hemoglobin synthesis towards HgbF. Therefore, the correct effect of hydroxyurea is to increase levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).

Answer: B",1411
483,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, confusion, and asterixis, which are signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The low serum glucose (59 mg/dL) suggests hypoglycemia, which can exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing ammonia levels through osmotic action. Potassium supplementation is not indicated here as the potassium level is within normal range. Dextrose can be used to treat hypoglycemia, but it does not address the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin is an antibiotic used for bacterial overgrowth in the gut but is not the primary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.

Answer: B",1775
484,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 4-month-old girl with a reddened and swollen 2nd toe that has not responded to calming efforts. Raynaud phenomenon typically presents with episodic color changes (white, blue, then red) and is not usually associated with persistent swelling and crying. Hair tourniquet syndrome involves a hair loop constricting a digit, which would not explain the swelling and redness. Herpetic whitlow is more commonly seen in older individuals and is caused by HSV, often in healthcare workers or those with oral HSV exposure. Given the young age and the localized swelling without other systemic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is an ingrown toenail, which can cause significant pain and swelling in infants.

Answer: B",2109
485,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with episodes of difficulty swallowing, feeling solid food getting stuck in her chest, and eosinophilic infiltration on mucosal biopsy, which suggests eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Budesonide is used for asthma and eczema, fluconazole is used for fungal infections, nitroglycerin is used for cardiovascular conditions, and omeprazole is used for GERD and acid-related conditions. Given the eosinophilic infiltration, omeprazole would help reduce acid exposure and potentially alleviate symptoms. Budesonide is not indicated for EoE, fluconazole is not relevant, and nitroglycerin is not appropriate for this condition.

Answer: D",1652
486,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with respiratory distress, a hacking cough, and a high-pitched noise with every breath. These symptoms suggest a foreign body aspiration, which can cause significant airway obstruction leading to respiratory distress. The absence of toys in the bed and no access to small objects makes it less likely that the symptoms are due to a common cold or other viral infections. 

Option A is inappropriate as humidified oxygen and dexamethasone would not address the need for removal of a potential foreign body. Option B involves dexamethasone and racemic epinephrine, which are not indicated for foreign body aspiration. Option D is too aggressive and unnecessary given the lack of severe infection signs. 

Answer: C",1946
487,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include memory loss, personality changes, rapid mental deterioration, sudden jerking movements, and gait disturbances, progressing to a coma and death. These symptoms are consistent with a neurodegenerative process rather than an autoimmune or inflammatory condition. The conversion of a protein from an α-helix to a β-pleated sheet (Option C) is characteristic of prion diseases, which can cause similar symptoms. Loss of dopaminergic neurons (Option A) typically causes Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, not the cognitive and behavioral changes described. Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination (Option B) are more commonly associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis, which do not usually present with the rapid progression and cognitive decline seen here. Frontotemporal atrophy and tau accumulation (Option D) are features of frontotemporal dementia, which fits the clinical presentation well.

Answer: C",1653
488,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with eye dryness and a foreign body sensation, along with mucosal ulceration and atrophy in the oral cavity. These symptoms are characteristic of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder affecting exocrine glands. The biopsy of the lower lip showing marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands further supports this diagnosis. Among the given options, Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody is commonly associated with Sjögren's syndrome. Anti-centromere antibody is associated with pulmonary-renal syndrome, Anti-Jo-1 antibody is associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and Anti-Scl-70 antibodies are associated with systemic sclerosis. Therefore, the most likely antibody present in this patient is Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody.

Answer: A",1769
489,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has chronic bronchitis with a history of smoking and presents with shortness of breath and cough. The physical exam shows coarse crackles, indicating airway obstruction. Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways, which can help relieve bronchoconstriction. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer. None of these directly antagonize vagal stimulation. Therefore, Tiotropium is the most likely drug started.

Answer: C",1367
490,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has sparse axillary and pubic hair, delayed genital development (Tanner stage 1), and impaired sense of smell since birth. These findings suggest a failure in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Hyperprolactinemia can affect olfactory function but does not typically cause delayed puberty. Compression of the pituitary stalk and decreased thyroxine production do not directly explain the sparse hair and genital development. Impaired migration of GnRH neurons would disrupt the release of gonadotropins, leading to delayed puberty and other signs consistent with the patient's presentation.

Answer: C",1732
491,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The scenario describes a situation where a physician is treating a patient for a post-exposure prophylaxis regimen and the patient invites the physician on a date. According to professional ethics and guidelines, physicians must maintain boundaries and avoid dual relationships that could compromise patient care or lead to conflicts of interest. Romantic relationships with current patients are generally considered unethical due to potential biases and power imbalances.

Eliminating incorrect options:
- Option B is incorrect because it violates ethical standards and could compromise patient care.
- Option D is incorrect because it suggests a temporary solution without addressing the underlying ethical issue.
- Option C is overly restrictive and does not align with the principle of maintaining professional boundaries.

Answer: A",2387
492,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, weight loss, night sweats, and blood-tinged sputum, along with consolidation in the apical part of the right lung. The white blood cell differential shows a predominance of lymphocytes (54%) and eosinophils (11%), which suggests an allergic or parasitic etiology. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated (84 mm), indicating inflammation. The presence of granulomas with Anitchov cells (which are eosinophilic giant cells) and fibrinoid necrosis is characteristic of eosinophilic granulomas, commonly seen in conditions like eosinophilic pneumonia or parasitic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis. 

Answer: B",2109
493,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Ipratropium bromide is a muscarinic antagonist that blocks M3 muscarinic receptors, reducing bronchoconstriction and improving airflow. This action is mediated through the phosphoinositol system, which is involved in the signaling pathway of muscarinic receptors. The cGMP system, arachidonic acid system, and tyrosine kinase system are not directly involved in the action of ipratropium bromide.

Answer: C",2003
494,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The smaller newborn has a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot, while the larger newborn does not have these abnormalities. The hematocrit levels are higher in the smaller newborn compared to the larger one. These findings suggest that the smaller newborn is likely receiving less oxygen due to a shared placental circulation, which is characteristic of monochorionic twins. The absence of other anomalies and the difference in hematocrit levels further support this. Conjoined twins would present with more complex and consistent anomalies, and the differences in hematocrit levels are not typical for conjoined twins. Therefore, the most likely scenario is monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic twins.

Answer: A",1485
495,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of obesity, which increases the risk of developing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Additionally, the patient is on tamoxifen, a medication known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. There is no information suggesting increased bleeding, eruption of seborrheic keratoses, or osteoporosis as direct complications of her current treatment or condition.

Answer: A",2210
496,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with agitation, confusion, lethargy, and progressive headaches and visual impairment. These symptoms suggest a neurological condition. Hypernatremia is present with a serum sodium level of 148 mEq/L. The osmolality is elevated at 300 mOsmol/kg H2O, indicating a state of hyperosmolar hypernatremia. This condition is typically caused by inadequate water intake relative to solute intake, leading to increased serum sodium levels. 

- Option A (Increased water intake) is unlikely as it would not cause hypernatremia.
- Option B (Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion) is not related to hypernatremia.
- Option C (Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion) would lead to polyuria and hypotonicity, not hypernatremia.
- Option D (Decreased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion) is not relevant to hypernatremia.

Answer: C",2238
497,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with blurred vision, pain around the right eye during movement, and optic disk swelling, indicating a potential optic neuritis. The fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye, and the color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. These findings are consistent with optic neuritis rather than dry eyes, oral ulcers, or high-risk sexual behavior. Sensory loss could be related to peripheral neuropathy but does not directly explain the specific ocular symptoms.

Answer: D",2216
498,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with cyclic vomiting, dehydration, and signs of hypovolemia such as tachycardia, dizziness on standing, sunken eyes, and a dry tongue. These symptoms suggest significant fluid and electrolyte loss, leading to hypovolemic shock and metabolic acidosis. The pH should be low (below 7.35), indicating acidosis, and the bicarbonate level should be low, reflecting metabolic acidosis. The CO2 levels should be low due to hypoventilation or compensatory mechanisms. Option B (pH = 7.2, Pco2 = 25 mm Hg, HCO32- = 30 mEq/L) fits these criteria, showing metabolic acidosis with a low pH and bicarbonate, and a low CO2 consistent with hypoventilation or compensation.

Answer: B",2005
499,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include infertility, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and a history of severe pneumonia. These symptoms suggest a potential underlying genetic disorder affecting the immune system or cellular function. Cardiac auscultation being silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line could indicate a defect in the cytoskeleton, given that the heart muscle relies on a functional cytoskeleton for proper function. Among the given options, microtubule monomeric proteins are key components of the cytoskeleton. Therefore, a mutation in these proteins could explain the patient's symptoms.

Answer: A",1526
500,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation, along with a distended abdomen and high-pitched bowel sounds. These symptoms suggest an obstruction rather than inflammation or perforation. The x-ray findings of a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies are consistent with a volvulus or torsion of the large intestine, which can cause such findings. Perforation would typically present with peritonitis and signs of infection, while gallbladder inflammation would not explain the bowel findings. The common bile duct obstruction would more commonly present with jaundice and altered liver function tests.

Answer: D",1728
501,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient developed fever, redness, purulent discharge, and worsening symptoms despite initial treatment with dicloxacillin. This suggests a resistant strain of bacteria. Among the options, only MRSA can develop resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like dicloxacillin through mechanisms such as producing beta-lactamase enzymes. The other options do not directly relate to the failure of beta-lactam antibiotics.

Answer: B",1704
502,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a 2 cm nodule on her neck with a radionucleotide scan showing a cold nodule, and fine needle aspiration biopsy suspicious for malignancy. Given these findings, a surgical excision is the most appropriate next step to obtain a definitive diagnosis and manage the suspected malignancy.

Answer: B",1955
503,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The pulmonary wedge pressure (PCWP) is 10 mmHg, which is within normal limits. Normal PCWP ranges from 6 to 12 mmHg. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) is typically higher than the PCWP but not as high as the systemic arterial pressure. The right ventricular diastolic pressure (RVDP) is usually close to the PCWP. Therefore, the right ventricular pressures should be higher than the PCWP but not as high as the systemic arterial pressure. Option A (25/10 mmHg) and Option B (25/5 mmHg) are too high for the RVSP. Option C (10/0 mmHg) is too low for both systolic and diastolic pressures. Option D (100/70 mmHg) is also too high for the RVSP.

Answer: B",1821
504,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The child has bilateral retracted and immobile tympanic membranes, indicating possible Eustachian tube dysfunction leading to conductive hearing loss. The history of recurrent ear infections and adenoid hypertrophy supports the need for adenoidectomy to prevent further infections and potential hearing loss. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may help with allergies but are not the primary treatment for structural issues like adenoid hypertrophy. Tympanostomy tubes are typically used for chronic middle ear effusions, not for adenoid-related issues.

Answer: A",1973
505,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: Sodium fluoroacetate is a potent rodenticide that works by inhibiting the enzyme fumarate hydratase, leading to the accumulation of fumarate in the cells. This inhibition disrupts the citric acid cycle, preventing the conversion of fumarate to malate. The patient's symptoms, including decreased consciousness, convulsions, and neurological deficits, are consistent with the disruption of the citric acid cycle and the accumulation of fumarate. 

Answer: A",2616
506,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, unarousability, and a history of multiple empty medication bottles, suggesting a possible drug overdose. The fluctuating level of consciousness and lack of orientation to time or place are consistent with acute intoxication or withdrawal. Hallucinations can occur in various intoxication states, particularly with certain drugs like alcohol or benzodiazepines. Irreversibility, multi-infarct dementia, and normal vital signs do not fit the acute presentation and fluctuating consciousness.

Answer: A",2195
507,Treatment,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with signs of pneumonia, including fever, cough, dyspnea, and lung infiltrates. Gram-negative rods were identified on Gram stain, suggesting a bacterial infection. Given the severity of the infection and the presence of gram-negative rods, broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary. Ertapenem is a carbapenem antibiotic, which is effective against many gram-negative bacteria. However, it may reduce the concentration of valproic acid, an anti-seizure medication, which is not applicable here as no such medication is mentioned. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are less broad-spectrum than carbapenems. Colistin is typically reserved for multidrug-resistant organisms. Cefepime and levofloxacin are also broad-spectrum but not as potent against gram-negative rods as carbapenems.

Answer: B",2378
508,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include hearing voices, erratic behavior, failing exams, spending large amounts of money on online shopping, and periods of insomnia and redecorating. These symptoms suggest a prolonged period of psychosis without a full six-month duration, which aligns more closely with schizoaffective disorder than brief psychotic disorder or schizophrenia-like disorders. Schizoaffective disorder specifically requires psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without prominent mood symptoms, which fits the patient's presentation.

Answer: B",2041
509,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of multiple strokes (left basal ganglia hemorrhage and right middle cerebral artery infarction) and progressive cognitive decline. The acute improvement in visual symptoms (right eye vision) is less indicative of NPH, where visual disturbances are typically progressive. Alzheimer's disease usually presents with gradual onset and does not show such acute changes in visual function. Lewy body dementia can present with fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations but does not typically cause sudden improvements in visual function. Vascular dementia, particularly multi-infarct dementia, fits the pattern of progressive cognitive decline following multiple strokes and the hemiparetic gait.

Answer: D",2764
510,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's viral load has increased from undetectable to 8,391 copies/mL, indicating non-adherence to her medication regimen. She admits to missing her medications every other day. The physician should address the underlying reasons for her non-adherence rather than simply reiterating the importance of daily adherence or providing a temporary solution like subsidizing medications. Option A encourages a discussion to understand the specific challenges she faces, which is the most appropriate response.

Answer: A",1434
511,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, and a bruit on the right side of the neck, indicating possible carotid artery disease. Given his symptoms of occasional weakness and numbness in his left hand, which could be related to cerebral ischemia, an ultrasound of the neck would help assess the carotid arteries for any stenosis or plaque. This is crucial before performing a femoropopliteal bypass surgery to ensure there are no underlying cerebrovascular issues.

Answer: A",2862
512,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient is concerned about pregnancy and has a positive home pregnancy test. Her thyroid function is normal with a TSH of 2.0 μU/mL, indicating good control of her hyperthyroidism. Methimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, and there is no indication to change the medication or add glucocorticoids for this scenario. Radioiodine therapy is used for long-term treatment of hyperthyroidism but is not indicated in this acute situation where pregnancy is suspected. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to continue the current medication.

Answer: A",2107
513,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include gradual worsening back pain, numbness and weakness in the legs, and relief during activities like biking or pushing a cart. These symptoms suggest nerve compression rather than a simple musculoskeletal issue. The patient's history of osteoporosis increases the risk of vertebral compression fractures, but the non-tender spine and normal mobility make this less likely. While alcohol and smoking could contribute to vascular issues, the specific pattern of symptoms points more towards spinal stenosis, which can cause neurogenic claudication (leg pain with walking).

Answer: D",2296
514,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has recurrent respiratory infections, abdominal cramps, and foul-smelling greasy diarrhea. These symptoms suggest a primary immunodeficiency. The stool microscopy showing pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms indicates a parasitic infection, specifically *Giardia lamblia*. This infection is associated with malabsorption and steatorrhea. Given the context of recurrent infections and the specific stool findings, the patient is at increased risk for disseminated tuberculosis, which can present with systemic symptoms and organ involvement.

Answer: D",1753
515,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a recent sore throat, pallor, and a rash with pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs. These symptoms suggest Kawasaki disease, a systemic vasculitis primarily affecting children. The characteristic rash and mucocutaneous findings, along with the non-congestive cardiac murmur, are key features. The ""starry sky"" appearance on histopathology is a hallmark of Kawasaki disease, characterized by a mononuclear cell infiltrate with scattered eosinophils. This finding distinguishes it from other conditions like rheumatic fever or infectious mononucleosis.

Answer: B",2083
516,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor commonly known to cause a dry, non-productive cough as a side effect. The other options do not have this side effect. Changing lisinopril to propanolol (a beta-blocker) or amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker) would not address the cough. Atorvastatin and lovastatin are statins and do not cause coughs. Losartan is an ARB and can be used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors without causing a cough.

Answer: D",1890
517,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The symptoms described include high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever, along with hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are indicative of neonatal phenobarbital toxicity, which can occur due to maternal use of phenytoin (PHT). PHT crosses the placenta and can cause these symptoms in the neonate. The other options do not typically cause these specific symptoms in a neonate.

Answer: B",1986
518,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 35-year-old primigravid woman with fever, headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, gum bleeding, and scleral icterus. These symptoms suggest a hemolytic process. The presence of petechiae and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is concerning for a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is characteristic of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Additionally, the positive urine RBCs and elevated lactate dehydrogenase support hemolysis. HELLP syndrome is associated with pregnancy and would not present in a non-pregnant woman. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with neurological symptoms and a more rapid onset. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia would not explain the thrombocytopenia and petechiae.

Answer: C",2520
519,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a significant drop in blood pressure (hypotension) and tachycardia, indicating potential internal bleeding. The presence of a gunshot wound to the chest and the need for intubation suggest possible pneumothorax or hemothorax, which could be life-threatening if not addressed promptly. The chest X-ray showing mild opacification of the right lower lobe and the need for mechanical ventilation further support this. While a CT scan would provide detailed imaging, it is not immediately life-saving. Local wound exploration and exploratory laparotomy are more invasive and not indicated without clear signs of abdominal trauma. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is too specific and not the first-line intervention.

Answer: A",2175
520,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The ATP2A1 gene mutation affects the calcium ATPase pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. This leads to impaired calcium reuptake, resulting in elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations. Elevated cytosolic calcium levels cause muscle stiffness and cramping, which are relieved by rest as the excess calcium is gradually removed. Therefore, the muscle relaxation time should be increased due to the higher cytosolic calcium levels.

Answer: B",1802
521,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm, nausea, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. The ECG shows changes consistent with ACS, and troponins are elevated. Given the patient's history of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, these factors increase the likelihood of coronary artery disease. The immediate treatment includes aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine to relieve pain. The next best step is to administer intravenous alteplase (tPA) to dissolve a potential thrombus, which can be life-saving in STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).

Answer: B",2112
522,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, and no bowel movements or flatus, suggesting a potential bowel obstruction. The frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds on auscultation and nonpropulsive peristalsis on ultrasound support this. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal surgery, and alcohol use do not directly explain the acute onset of symptoms and the specific findings. Ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal issues but does not typically lead to bowel obstruction. The history of porphyria is not indicated by the symptoms or findings.

Answer: B",3399
523,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Ulcerative colitis typically involves the colon, specifically the rectum and left side of the colon. The patient's symptoms of left-side abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and tenesmus are consistent with ulcerative colitis. Noncaseating granulomas and transmural inflammation are more characteristic of Crohn disease. Terminal ileum involvement is also more common in Crohn disease. Continuous mucosal damage is a feature of ulcerative colitis.

Answer: D",1257
524,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with difficulty breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, multiple respiratory infections, and low immunoglobulin titers. These symptoms suggest an immunodeficiency. The presence of disc-shaped cysts in the bronchial lavage fluid is indicative of a primary immunodeficiency, specifically a defect in B-cell maturation, which aligns with the presentation of a primary antibody deficiency. 

Answer: D",2027
525,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, dizziness, and lymphadenopathy, which are consistent with lymphoma. The elevated lymphocyte count (50%) and presence of CD20+ cells suggest a B-cell lymphoma, specifically non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hairy cells are associated with hairy cell leukemia, which does not fit the context of lymphoma. Low levels of erythropoietin are more indicative of anemia of chronic disease rather than lymphoma. Smudge cells are typically seen in lymphocytic leukemia, not in lymphoma. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) levels are often low in lymphoma.

Answer: B",2037
526,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus, which are indicative of a sedative-hypnotic overdose, such as phenobarbital or another barbiturate. The missing seizure medication in the grandson’s pills suggests phenobarbital. Phenobarbital is excreted via the kidneys, and its excretion can be accelerated by increasing urine output. Among the options, only mannitol is known to increase urine output and thus enhance the excretion of the substance responsible for the symptoms.

Answer: B",1680
527,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's recent travel to northern Brazil, high fever, myalgia, and jaundice are consistent with malaria. The low leukocyte count and splenomegaly are also suggestive. The laboratory findings, including elevated lactate dehydrogenase and jaundice, support this diagnosis. A thick and thin blood smear is the most reliable method to confirm malaria by identifying the parasite.

Answer: A",1898
528,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe pain and swelling in the inguinal area, fever, and tender lymph nodes, along with a history of painless red papules on the thigh. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative coccobacilli, and serum anti-F1 titers showed a 4-fold rise, indicating bubonic plague. The most appropriate treatment for bubonic plague is antibiotics effective against Yersinia pestis, such as doxycycline or gentamicin. Among the given options, azithromycin is not typically used for treating bubonic plague. Imipenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic but not specifically indicated for Yersinia pestis. Streptomycin can be used but is not the first-line agent. Therefore, no specific pharmacotherapy is listed among the options.

Answer: D",1729
529,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, which is a key symptom of CRAO. The absence of pain, presence of a bright red area within the macula, and a pale retina are consistent with CRAO. The normal appearance of the optic disc and intact accommodation further support this diagnosis. Other conditions like retinal detachment, acute angle-closure glaucoma, and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy do not match the specific presentation of this case.

Answer: B",2805
530,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden weakness on the right side, increased deep tendon reflexes (hyperreflexia), and a positive Babinski sign, indicating a possible central nervous system lesion. The left lower leg swelling, erythema, and tenderness suggest a peripheral vascular issue. Given the recent travel history and the presence of a patent foramen ovale, a carotid artery dissection is less likely as it typically presents with neck pain and not peripheral limb symptoms. Mitral valve vegetation and atrial fibrillation would not explain the neurological findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a patent foramen ovale leading to a paradoxical embolism causing the neurological deficits.

Answer: A",2088
531,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with classic signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis (low pH, low bicarbonate), and ketonuria. The patient also has signs of dehydration (dry skin/mucous membranes, tachypnea, tachycardia). Starting an IV of 0.9% NaCl is appropriate to correct hypovolemia. However, the next best step is to start an IV insulin infusion to manage the hyperglycemia and ketosis. Infusing NaHCO3 is not indicated unless there is severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.0) and ketone levels > 5 mmol/L, which is not the case here. Switching to 0.45% NaCl would further decrease the osmolarity and worsen dehydration. Replacing potassium is not urgent without evidence of hypokalemia.

Answer: C",2562
532,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with altered mental status, lethargy, hypothermia, bradycardia, and absent deep tendon reflexes. These symptoms are consistent with hypothermia, particularly given the cold environment and open windows. Hypothermia can lead to confusion, lethargy, and autonomic dysfunction, including bradycardia and absent reflexes. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and other chronic conditions makes him more susceptible to hypothermia. Lisinopril and atorvastatin are unlikely to cause these specific symptoms. Levothyroxine would not cause hypothermia; instead, it would be expected to improve symptoms in a hypothyroid patient. Fluphenazine can cause sedation and confusion but does not typically cause hypothermia or bradycardia.

Answer: B",2488
533,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, anemia, and proteinuria, indicative of significant kidney damage. The serum creatinine level of 4.6 mg/dL suggests advanced kidney dysfunction. The presence of hypercellular glomeruli with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane is characteristic of IgA nephropathy. Additionally, the positive C3 nephritic factor supports this diagnosis, as it is commonly associated with IgA nephropathy. 

Answer: B",1358
534,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of difficulty breathing, chronic shortness of breath on exertion and while lying down, and swelling of the feet. These symptoms suggest right-sided heart failure secondary to a pulmonary embolism. In right-sided heart failure, there is increased pressure in the right side of the heart leading to congestion in the lungs, which explains the crackles and wheezes. A loud P2 is commonly heard in right-sided heart failure due to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. The other options (S3 gallop, absent S4, and loud S1) are more indicative of left-sided heart failure or other conditions not fitting the clinical presentation.

Answer: A",1951
535,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group suggests higher variability in the measurements compared to the other groups. This is not related to external validity, statistical significance, or confidence intervals directly. Instead, it indicates a smaller sample size in this group, leading to wider confidence intervals and higher standard errors.
Answer: C",6062
536,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with profuse diverticular bleeding leading to significant anemia and liver enzyme elevation, particularly ALT and AST, which are more elevated than alkaline phosphatase. This pattern suggests hepatocellular injury rather than cholestatic or sinusoidal damage. Periportal hepatocytes are the first to be affected in many hepatocellular injuries due to their proximity to the portal triad. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells are less likely to be the primary site of injury in this scenario without additional evidence of sinusoidal or immune-mediated damage. Centrilobular hepatocytes are less commonly involved in initial hepatocellular injury from systemic causes.

Answer: A",3289
537,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a GCS of 6/15, indicating severe brain injury. The right pupil is fixed and dilated, suggesting uncal herniation or increased intracranial pressure. Given these critical findings, rapid induction of anesthesia is necessary. Propofol and sevoflurane are both viable options, but propofol provides a quicker onset of action, which is crucial in this emergency setting. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine and would provide sedation but not the rapid onset needed. Nitrous oxide is not suitable for deep anesthesia and does not provide the necessary depth of sedation required for this patient's condition.

Answer: A",2021
538,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI), including burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. The urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites, and the urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar, indicating lactose fermentation. This combination of symptoms and culture results suggests a typical UTI caused by a common pathogen like E. coli. 

The antibiotic used would likely target gram-negative bacteria. Among the options, only:
- A: Inhibits cell wall synthesis (e.g., β-lactams)
- B: Binds D-ala D-ala in the cell wall (e.g., penicillins)
- C: Inhibits initiation complex (e.g., tetracyclines)
- D: Inhibits sterol synthesis (e.g., fluoroquinolones)

Fluoroquinolones are commonly used to treat UTIs caused by gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of the antibiotic used is inhibiting sterol synthesis.

Answer: D",2055
539,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history of long-term smoking, chronic atrial fibrillation, and the presence of clubbing (enlarged fingertips and curved nails) along with reticular opacities on CT scan suggest a chronic process affecting the lung tissue rather than acute airway inflammation or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Pleural scarring is less likely given the absence of pleural signs and the nature of the imaging findings. Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung is consistent with the fibrotic changes seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which fits the patient's history and imaging findings.

Answer: D",2259
540,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history of major depressive disorder, difficulty concentrating, lack of social participation, and multiple suicide threats are consistent with a severe case of depression. The presence of a coma and a prolonged QT interval (450 ms) suggests a risk of torsades de pointes, a condition associated with certain antidepressants. Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to cause significant prolongation of the QT interval and is associated with a higher risk of torsades de pointes compared to SSRIs and SNRIs like sertraline, venlafaxine, and bupropion. Therefore, the most likely overdose is clomipramine.

Answer: D",2174
541,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The chi-square test was performed, and the odds ratio (OR) for the association between low education and the risk of MI was 2.1, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. An OR of 2.1 suggests a positive association, but the 95% confidence interval includes 1, indicating that the association is not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for MI based on this study.

Answer: D",1531
542,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's quadruple screening test shows a maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median, indicating a high risk for neural tube defects. The normal levels of β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A suggest that there is no increased risk for trisomy 18 or 21, which typically show abnormal levels for these markers. Partial molar pregnancy is usually associated with abnormal hCG levels, which are normal here. Therefore, the most likely explanation is a neural tube defect.

Answer: B",1477
543,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sharp chest pain radiating to the right hemithorax, which is a classic symptom of pulmonary embolism (PE). However, given the low risk and the absence of other symptoms like dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxemia, a V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiogram would be too invasive. A D-dimer test is a non-invasive initial screening tool for PE. An ECG is more useful for detecting arrhythmias or myocardial infarction rather than diagnosing PE. Therefore, the most reasonable first step is a D-dimer test.

Answer: C",2838
544,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of chronic joint pain in the PIP and MCP joints, which suggests a chronic inflammatory condition like rheumatoid arthritis. However, the acute onset of redness and swelling in the DIP joints after a laceration is more indicative of an acute inflammatory response, such as a bacterial infection or sterile inflammation. Neutrophils are typically the predominant cells in acute inflammation, while monocytes are more common in chronic inflammation. Given the acute nature of the DIP joint symptoms, there would likely be more neutrophils and possibly fewer monocytes compared to the chronic PIP and MCP joints.

Answer: B",1929
545,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient describes a dull pain over the sides of her head that is associated with chewing and worsens with jaw movements. This aligns with the symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), where pain and tenderness are often exacerbated by jaw movements. Migraine headaches typically present with pulsating or throbbing pain, not necessarily associated with jaw movements. Temporal arteritis would present with more systemic symptoms like flu-like symptoms and visual disturbances, which are not present here. Tension headaches usually affect both sides of the head and are not specifically associated with jaw movements.

Answer: C",1815
546,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of asthma, but his symptoms have not been well-controlled with albuterol, as evidenced by the new onset of shortness of breath post-surgery. Additionally, the reduced breath sounds over the left lung base and the presence of a clean, dry surgical incision suggest a potential pulmonary issue rather than a respiratory issue related to asthma. While pneumonitis and pulmonary embolism could cause similar symptoms, the sudden onset and the presence of reduced breath sounds are more indicative of pulmonary embolism, which often presents with sudden shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. Atelectasis typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and is less likely given the acute nature of the symptoms.

Answer: C",2464
547,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of facial droop and weakness in the left side of the body, consistent with a stroke. The presence of a right-sided carotid bruit suggests possible carotid artery disease. Given the acute neurological deficits, an imaging study of the brain is needed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the lesion. An MRI provides better soft tissue contrast compared to a CT scan and can better delineate the extent of the stroke. A lumbar puncture is not indicated unless there is suspicion of meningitis or other conditions requiring CSF analysis. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck can evaluate carotid artery stenosis but should be done after confirming the diagnosis of stroke. A CT scan of the head can quickly rule out hemorrhagic stroke but does not provide the same level of detail as an MRI.

Answer: A",3038
548,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has been on antitubercular therapy and now presents with new symptoms including fever, cough, and lymphadenopathy, along with a significant increase in CD4+ T cell count and a positive tuberculin skin test. These findings suggest that the patient may have developed an opportunistic infection such as disseminated tuberculosis or other infections common in immunocompromised individuals. Continuing both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy is appropriate given the ongoing tuberculosis treatment and the need for immune support. Changing the antitubercular regimen would not address the new symptoms and could complicate treatment.

Answer: D",1450
549,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 6-year-old boy presenting with fever, malaise, and intense pain in the anterior neck, which worsens with neck hyperextension and improves with neck flexion. These symptoms suggest a localized infection or inflammation rather than an autoimmune thyroid disorder. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits, ruling out hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. The ultrasound finding of a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space is consistent with a pyriform sinus fistula, which can cause similar symptoms due to its proximity to the thyroid gland and its ability to cause local inflammation and pain.

Answer: B",2106
550,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 65-year-old man with red-colored urine without dysuria or costovertebral angle tenderness. Bladder tumors and renal cell carcinoma are both potential causes of hematuria, but they would typically present with more localized symptoms like costovertebral angle tenderness. Beeturia, which is the presence of beets in the urine, can cause red-colored urine but is usually associated with a known beet intake. A urinary tract infection (UTI) could also cause hematuria but often presents with dysuria and other systemic symptoms. Given the absence of these symptoms, the most likely cause is beeturia.

Answer: C",1758
551,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including confusion, frequent urination, excessive thirst, and a high blood glucose level. The low pH indicates metabolic acidosis, which is a hallmark of DKA. The decreased levels of the hormone mentioned (likely insulin) lead to increased glucose uptake by adipocytes being impaired, increased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, increased proteolysis, and decreased lipoprotein lipase activity. However, the question specifically asks about a life-threatening complication related to decreased levels of a hormone, which in this context is likely insulin. Insulin deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.

Answer: A",2252
552,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and dilated bile ducts on ultrasound, indicative of acute cholangitis or choledocholithiasis. The patient's condition has worsened with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, suggesting possible sepsis from an obstructed common bile duct. ERCP is the most appropriate next step to both diagnose and treat the obstruction by removing the stones and relieving the obstruction.

Answer: A",2799
553,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has elevated aldosterone levels and the physician wants to initiate an aldosterone receptor antagonist. Spironolactone (Option A) is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist but can cause side effects like impotence and gynecomastia, matching the patient's concerns. Triamterene (Option C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic and not an aldosterone receptor antagonist. Eplerenone (Option B) is a specific aldosterone receptor antagonist with fewer sexual side effects compared to spironolactone. Ethacrynic acid (Option D) is a loop diuretic and not an aldosterone receptor antagonist. Given the patient's concerns and the need for an aldosterone receptor antagonist, Eplerenone is the best choice.

Answer: B",1656
554,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating, and shortness of breath, which are consistent with a panic attack. The symptoms resolved on their own without intervention, and her vitals normalized. Given the context, the most likely diagnosis is a panic attack. The criteria for a panic attack do not require a specific duration of symptoms or a family history. However, disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions would align with the pattern of a panic attack. Family history and agoraphobia are not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of a panic attack in this scenario.

Answer: B",2338
555,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient exhibits severe suicidal ideation with a concrete plan to use a firearm, indicating a high risk of suicide. He has been isolated and shows constricted affect, suggesting emotional dysregulation consistent with borderline personality disorder. Given the severity of his symptoms and the risk of immediate harm, involuntary hospitalization is the most appropriate next step to ensure his safety.

Answer: B",2571
556,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a palpable swelling in the left axilla, tender lymphadenopathy, and histopathologic findings of necrotizing granulomas. These findings are consistent with bacillary angiomatosis, which is caused by Bartonella bacteria. Condylomata lata is associated with syphilis and does not present with axillary lymphadenopathy. Brucellosis typically causes fever, sweating, and joint pain but not the specific skin lesions described. Bubonic plague is caused by Yersinia pestis and presents with bubo formation but not the necrotizing granulomas seen here. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Bartonella, which is also involved in bacillary angiomatosis.

Answer: A",1840
557,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe dyspnea, a productive cough with hemoptysis, a pruritic papular rash on the thigh, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. These symptoms suggest a rapidly progressing bacterial infection. 

- **Lyme disease** is characterized by an expanding red rash (erythema migrans) and is not associated with severe dyspnea or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
- **Malaria** typically presents with fever, chills, and fatigue but does not cause inguinal lymphadenopathy or severe respiratory symptoms.
- **Plague** can present with a painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes) and sepsis-like symptoms, including hypotension and respiratory distress, which align with the patient’s presentation.
- **Legionnaires' disease** presents with cough, shortness of breath, fever, and muscle pain but does not typically cause inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Answer: C",2637
558,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with small, dome-shaped, hardened papules on the thigh with central umbilication, which are non-pruritic and have been present for 3 weeks. These characteristics are consistent with molluscum contagiosum, a viral infection caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus. Bed bug bites typically cause itchy, red, and sometimes blistered lesions. Atopic dermatitis usually presents with itchy, red, and swollen skin. Acute urticaria causes itchy, raised welts that are transient and not persistent like the patient's lesions. The presence of non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy could suggest a viral infection, further supporting molluscum contagiosum.

Answer: B",2808
559,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The politician has secret homosexual desires but publicly criticizes gay people. This is a classic example of reaction formation, where an individual expresses attitudes opposite to their unconscious desires.

Answer: B",973
560,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's INR is 1.0, indicating that warfarin levels are likely within the therapeutic range. Dietary changes to a vegetarian diet should not significantly impact INR unless there is a sudden change in vitamin K intake, which is unlikely to cause an immediate INR of 1.0. Increased hepatic metabolism or renal clearance would not explain the normal INR. Medication noncompliance could potentially affect INR, but given the normal INR, this is less likely.

Answer: A",2939
561,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe bilateral flank pain, tea-colored urine, and signs of dehydration (dry, hot, erythematous skin). These symptoms suggest acute kidney injury. The urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs, which is consistent with hemoglobinuria, often seen in heat stroke. The patient's recent URI and family history of CKD further support this. Heat stroke is the most likely cause given the environmental conditions and clinical presentation. Other options like IgA nephropathy would typically present with microscopic hematuria, and Neisseria meningitidis would present with meningitis-like symptoms rather than renal failure. 

Answer: C",2568
562,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: Hyperestrinism in cirrhotic patients results from the liver's reduced ability to inactivate estrogen. This leads to increased levels of estrogen in the body, causing various signs and symptoms. Coagulopathy is related to impaired clotting factors, gynecomastia is due to increased estrogen levels, jaundice is a sign of liver dysfunction, and caput medusae is a sign of portal hypertension. Among these, caput medusae is a direct result of portal hypertension, not specifically hyperestrinism.

Answer: D",2219
563,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has postcoital vaginal bleeding and intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge, which are common symptoms of clear-cell adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina supports this diagnosis. Melanoma and verrucous carcinoma are less likely given the absence of skin lesions or typical characteristics of those tumors. Botryoid sarcoma, while rare, typically presents with a grape-like mass in the genitourinary tract, but the patient's history and symptoms more closely align with clear-cell adenocarcinoma.

Answer: A",2034
564,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of weak tumescence and low libido are likely related to his generalized anxiety disorder, which is being treated with citalopram. Citalopram is known to have side effects including sexual dysfunction. Lowering the dose or switching to another SSRI like selegiline might help manage these side effects. However, adding bupropion, which is not an SSRI, may not directly address the sexual dysfunction. Fluoxetine is also an SSRI and could potentially cause similar side effects. Therefore, the best approach is to consider lowering the citalopram dose.

Answer: A",2037
565,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with unexplained weight loss, recurrent fevers, night sweats, and generalized lymphadenopathy. These symptoms suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily, and flow cytometry shows lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23, which are consistent with a B-cell lymphoma. Given these findings, the most appropriate treatment would be a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

Answer: B",1992
566,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presented with severe, crushing, substernal chest pain and ST-elevations in leads I and aVL, which are characteristic of an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) involving the left circumflex artery. The left circumflex artery supplies the posterolateral portion of the left ventricle and the inferior wall, and its involvement often presents with ST-elevations in leads I and aVL. The left anterior descending artery typically presents with ST-elevations in the anterior leads (V2-V4), and the right marginal artery usually presents with ST-elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). Given the presentation and ECG findings, the left circumflex artery is the most likely vessel affected.

Answer: B",2287
567,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include sharp, shooting pain in both legs, decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch, absent patellar reflexes, and an unsteady, broad-based gait. These findings suggest peripheral neuropathy. The history of a painless ulcer on the penis 20 years ago is significant as it could indicate diabetes mellitus, which is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. The absence of other serious illnesses and the specific neurological findings point towards a neurologic condition rather than heart-related issues like AV block or MR. Penile squamous cell carcinoma would not typically present with these systemic neurological symptoms. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is less likely given the absence of other cardiovascular symptoms.

Answer: A",1769
568,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe pruritus, fatigue, scleral icterus, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, ALP, GGTP, immunoglobulins, and cholesterol. The presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies and bile duct injury on liver biopsy are key findings. These clinical features and laboratory results are consistent with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis. Hemolytic anemia would not cause elevated liver enzymes or bile duct injury. Hepatitis A would show antiviral antibodies and is less likely given the chronic nature of the symptoms. Gilbert syndrome typically does not cause significant elevations in liver enzymes or bile duct injury.
Answer: A",2312
569,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient initially presented with belligerent behavior, unconsciousness, and then developed muscle rigidity and altered mental status. These symptoms are consistent with a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can occur as a side effect of antipsychotic drugs like chlorpromazine. Given the patient's recent exposure to alcohol and the development of NMS-like symptoms, the best next step is to manage the condition appropriately.

Answer: C",3146
570,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has pain in the anterior proximal tibia, which is exacerbated by activities like jogging and climbing stairs. The x-ray shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity, indicating an avulsion fracture. Immediate surgical intervention (open reduction) is not indicated without clear instability or open wound. Joint aspiration is not necessary for this condition. Oral ketorolac can provide pain relief but does not address the underlying fracture. A lower leg cast would immobilize the area and allow healing.

Answer: D",1737
571,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has fever, chills, right-sided chest pain, and a productive cough, which are consistent with pneumonia. The presence of inspiratory crackles at the right lung base further supports this. While subphrenic abscess can present with similar symptoms, the location of the surgical incision and the absence of other specific signs (like tenderness over the 8th-11th ribs) make it less likely. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with shortness of breath, chest pain, and sometimes a mild fever but lacks the localized findings in the right lung base. Pneumothorax would present with sudden onset of sharp chest pain and hypoxia, which are not present here.

Answer: C",2469
572,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's rash has been present for 3 months and is associated with moving to a new outdoor job in Nevada. This suggests a possible diagnosis of actinic prurigo, a chronic photosensitive dermatitis. The rash is likely due to sun exposure. Topical treatments like metronidazole or benzoyl peroxide are not indicated for this condition. Clonidine is used for hypertension and unrelated to skin conditions. Tetracycline, specifically doxycycline, is often used for treating photosensitive dermatoses due to its anti-inflammatory and photoprotective effects.

Answer: A",1474
573,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise, along with wide splitting of S2 and a loud second component of S2 best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. These findings suggest a right-to-left shunt, which can cause wide splitting of S2 and a loud second component due to increased blood flow through the pulmonary valve. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:
- Increased right ventricular preload would not explain the wide splitting of S2.
- Increased left ventricular preload would not explain the specific location and nature of the S2 splitting.
- Increased right ventricular afterload would not explain the loud S2 and wide splitting.

Answer: D",1785
574,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: Kawasaki disease primarily affects small to medium-sized blood vessels and does not typically result in a loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes. The symptoms described (pitting edema and proteinuria >3.5g/24h) suggest a condition affecting the glomeruli, such as a primary glomerulonephritis. Polyanion loss in the glomerular basement membrane would lead to increased negative charge, attracting positively charged proteins, resulting in non-selective proteinuria. WBC casts are indicative of inflammation, selective albuminuria suggests minimal change nephropathy, negatively birefringent crystals are associated with crystal-induced nephropathy, and Bence-Jones proteinuria is seen in multiple myeloma. None of these findings directly indicate a loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membrane.

Answer: C",2186
575,Mechanism,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include neck pain, shoulder pain, arm pain, and weakness in the right wrist, indicating a possible nerve root compression. The MRI would show the structure causing compression. Given that the neural tube forms the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), it is unlikely to be the source of nerve root compression in this scenario. The notochord and neural crest are also not directly involved in forming peripheral nerves. The surface ectoderm forms skin and related structures, which are not typically involved in nerve root compression. Therefore, the most likely source of nerve root compression is derived from the neural tube.

Answer: C",1939
576,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with acute onset left-sided lower abdominal pain during physical activity, left adnexal tenderness, guarding, and a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch on ultrasound. These findings are highly suggestive of ovarian torsion, given the sudden onset of pain and the presence of adnexal tenderness. Ectopic pregnancy would typically present with more localized pain, often in the lower abdomen, but without the adnexal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic inflammatory disease would not typically present with such a sudden onset of pain or the specific ultrasound findings. A ruptured ovarian cyst might present with pain and tenderness, but the presence of free fluid in the rectouterine pouch is more indicative of torsion.
Answer: B",2239
577,Mechanism,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with leg swelling, right upper abdominal tenderness, fatigue, syncope, and a history of myocardial infarction. These symptoms suggest heart failure with liver congestion. The presence of jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and hepatomegaly with hepatojugular reflux indicate right-sided heart failure. An echocardiogram in such cases often shows left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction leading to hypokinesis of the left ventricular walls. 

Answer: C",2880
578,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms align with hoarding disorder, characterized by persistent difficulty in discarding items and excessive acquisition of possessions. She has tried cognitive behavioral therapy without improvement, indicating a need for pharmacological intervention. Fluoxetine is commonly used to treat hoarding disorder due to its effect on serotonin levels. Lamotrigine is used for bipolar disorder and depression but not specifically for hoarding disorder. Buspirone is used for generalized anxiety disorder but not for hoarding disorder. Methylphenidate is used for ADHD and not for hoarding disorder.

Answer: A",2336
579,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent renal stones, a recent fall resulting in fractures, and current hip and shoulder pain. These symptoms suggest a condition like osteoporosis or a metabolic bone disorder. The serum findings show slightly low phosphate levels (2.3 mg/dL) and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase (120 U/L), which can indicate bone turnover. A radiograph of the right hip would most likely show medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone, consistent with a pathologic fracture or bone metastasis.

Answer: B",2775
580,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing recent stress due to her father's death, which could suggest an adjustment disorder. However, her symptoms include hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts, which are more indicative of a psychotic disorder. Brief psychotic disorder is ruled out as the symptoms have persisted beyond the typical 1-month window. Bereavement typically does not involve psychotic symptoms. Schizophrenia is less likely given the acute onset and the absence of other typical long-term symptoms like disorganized thinking or behavior. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is brief psychotic disorder.

Answer: A",2338
581,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss, anxiety, palpitations, fine hand tremors, and exophthalmos. The irregular pulse rate of 140-150/min is consistent with a rapid heart rate seen in hyperthyroidism. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a short PR interval is a common finding in hyperthyroidism due to increased conduction through the AV node. Digoxin and amiodarone can affect the PR interval, but age alone does not have a specific correlation with heart rhythm in this context. Therefore, the most relevant factor is the PR interval, which is directly affected by hyperthyroidism.

Answer: B",1635
582,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, which are consistent with a bacterial infection affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The consumption of undercooked ground beef suggests a possible contamination with *Escherichia coli* O157:H7, which produces Shiga toxin. This toxin specifically targets the 60S ribosomal subunit, leading to cell death in intestinal epithelial cells. None of the other options (actin depolymerization, increased pH, or increased cAMP) are mechanisms associated with *E. coli* O157:H7 infection.

Answer: D",2821
583,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with intermittent nausea and vomiting, weakness, and back/leg pain. These symptoms are non-specific but could be indicative of various conditions. The recent travel and antibiotic use suggest a possible infectious etiology. However, the flattening of the T wave on EKG is more suggestive of hypokalemia, which can be treated with a thiazide diuretic. Given the patient's symptoms and the treatment with a thiazide, the most likely underlying condition is Sjögren's syndrome, as it can present with fatigue, joint pain, and other systemic symptoms without a clear infectious cause. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Wilson's disease do not typically present with the specific combination of symptoms and the need for thiazide therapy.

Answer: B",1948
584,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient had a traumatic pneumothorax due to the motor vehicle collision, which was initially managed with needle decompression and chest tube placement. However, the recurrent pneumothrax despite tube placement suggests a more complex underlying issue. Subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area is indicative of a tracheobronchial rupture, which can lead to persistent air leaks and recurrent pneumothorax. Inappropriate chest tube placement or spontaneous pneumothorax would not explain the recurrent nature of the pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax typically presents with symptoms like hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress without the need for repeated intervention.

Answer: D",1994
585,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath, substernal chest pain, nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise. Physical examination reveals distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds. These findings suggest pericardial tamponade, where there is compression of the heart due to pericardial effusion, leading to muffled heart sounds and distended neck veins. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude, which are consistent with pericardial tamponade. Kawasaki disease, rheumatic fever, and infective endocarditis do not present with these specific findings.

Answer: D",1868
586,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with headaches, blurry vision, and difficulty achieving an erection. These symptoms suggest a mass in the sellar region affecting multiple functions. The temporal visual field deficit and intrasellar mass are indicative of a pituitary adenoma. The difficulty achieving an erection points to a possible compression of the pituitary stalk, leading to hypogonadism. Among the pituitary cell types, lactotrophs are involved in producing prolactin, which can affect male sexual function when dysregulated. Thyrotrophs, somatotrophs, and gonadotrophs do not directly relate to sexual function in this context. Therefore, the most likely origin of the mass is from a lactotroph.

Answer: B",1750
587,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, which can lead to various congenital anomalies in the fetus. The fundal height of 20 cm at 18 weeks is slightly smaller than expected, suggesting a possible intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Sacral agenesis and spina bifida are both associated with neural tube defects, but they are not typically linked to poor maternal glucose control. Amelia (congenital absence of one or both legs) is not commonly associated with diabetes. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a cardiac anomaly but is not specifically linked to poor maternal diabetes control. Given the context of poor diabetic control and the potential for IUGR, the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound is a neural tube defect, such as sacral agenesis.

Answer: B",1565
588,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a feeling of a foreign body in the vagina that worsens on standing, indicating a prolapse. The gynecologic examination shows descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus, which increases on Valsalva and standing. This suggests a mild to moderate uterine prolapse. Given the patient's symptoms and the findings, a support pessary can provide temporary relief by supporting the prolapsed tissue. A space-filling pessary might be more appropriate for severe cases, posterior colporrhaphy addresses specific defects in the vaginal walls, and sacral colpopexy is a more extensive procedure typically reserved for severe cases. 

Answer: A",2464
589,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden-onset, severe right flank pain without trauma, and a large simple cyst on the right ovary. The absence of flow in the right ovarian vein suggests possible venous thrombosis or occlusion, which can lead to ischemia and subsequent pain. The ovarian ligaments, including the infundibulopelvic ligament, are involved in supporting the ovary and can be landmarks for surgical procedures involving the ovary. Given the location of the pain and the abnormal Doppler findings, the infundibulopelvic ligament is the most likely to have been involved due to its proximity to the ovarian vessels.

Answer: D",1762
590,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible underlying hematologic disorder. The presence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly is more indicative of a lymphoproliferative disorder, which often leads to hypergammaglobulinemia. Ringed sideroblasts are more commonly associated with sideroblastic anemia, and smudge cells are typically seen in certain types of leukemia. Teardrop cells are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes. Given the context of hypergammaglobulinemia, the most likely finding would be hypergammaglobulinemia itself.

Answer: D",1853
591,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, scant vaginal bleeding, and a positive pregnancy test. These symptoms suggest a possible ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Given her history of a previous pelvic infection and delayed period, the most likely organism causing these symptoms is *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, as it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can complicate pregnancy and cause these symptoms. *Candida albicans* typically causes yeast infections without severe systemic symptoms. *Chlamydia trachomatis* can also cause PID but is less likely to present with such severe symptoms compared to *N. gonorrhoeae*. *Haemophilus influenzae* is not a common cause of genital infections leading to these symptoms.

Answer: B",2318
592,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has hepatitis C, which is a viral infection. Interferon-α is often used in combination with another antiviral drug for treating hepatitis C. The additional drug would target the viral replication process. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is involved in purine biosynthesis, DNA gyrase is involved in DNA topology, and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is involved in transcription, not viral replication. Therefore, the additional drug is most likely targeting the viral RNA polymerase.

Answer: B",1868
593,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 31%, indicating anemia. The colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon, suggesting a colorectal tumor. Colorectal cancer is often associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects, leading to microsatellite instability (MSI). This defect results in uncorrected DNA mismatches, leading to increased mutation rates and tumor formation. Therefore, the most likely impaired process in this patient is DNA mismatch repair.

Answer: C",2241
594,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain, especially occurring after meals and subsiding hours later, are more consistent with a gastric peptic ulcer rather than choledocholithiasis or pancreatitis, which typically present with more severe and constant pain. Gallbladder cancer is less likely given the absence of other systemic symptoms and the relatively short duration of symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a gastric peptic ulcer.

Answer: C",1989
595,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient experienced a ""pop"" followed by severe throbbing pain and swelling, along with positive anterior drawer and Lachman’s tests. These findings suggest an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which prevents excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. The other options do not align with the clinical presentation.

Answer: B",1450
596,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The newborn shows tachypnea and cyanosis, indicating severe respiratory distress. The inhaled medication that increases cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) suggests it is likely a bronchodilator, such as albuterol. This improvement followed by a recurrence of tachypnea and cyanosis indicates a possible closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The ductus arteriosus normally closes shortly after birth, but in premature infants or those with certain conditions, it may remain open. The recurrence of symptoms despite treatment with a bronchodilator points towards PDA closure, which can lead to a sudden increase in pulmonary artery pressure and subsequent hypoxemia causing cyanosis.

Answer: B",1420
597,Treatment,False,D,B,"Reasoning: Picornaviruses, such as hepatitis A virus, are known to infect hepatocytes. Chlorhexidine is effective against many bacteria but not typically against viruses. Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive and not used as a disinfectant. Sodium hypochlorite is effective against a wide range of microorganisms including viruses but is not specifically noted for picornaviruses. Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is known to inactivate many viruses, including those in the picornavirus family.

Answer: D",1270
598,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms commonly associated with early pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, weight gain, and nausea. However, her urine β-hCG test is negative, and transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. These findings are inconsistent with a true pregnancy. The patient's uncertainty about the date of her last menstrual period and her recent attempt to conceive further suggest that she might be experiencing false pregnancy symptoms. Delusion of pregnancy and incomplete abortion are less likely given the absence of significant abdominal enlargement and closed cervical os. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pseudocyesis.

Answer: B",1763
599,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include frequent repetition of information, needing reminders, claiming to be a famous poet, and having atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. These findings are consistent with Korsakoff's syndrome, a form of severe memory impairment often caused by chronic alcohol abuse. The constricted affect and lack of long-term memory deficits further support this diagnosis. There is no indication of a spirochete infection, chronic hypertension, or consumption of undercooked meat that would explain these specific neurological findings.

Answer: C",2437
600,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid enhances immune responses in infants who have not yet developed significant levels of polysaccharide-specific antibodies. This conjugation strategy is particularly effective in generating protective antibody responses in young children, including those under one year of age.

Answer: D",987
601,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals is typically triggered by an increase in intracellular calcium levels. This is a well-known mechanism for neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses. The other options (G protein-coupled receptors, cAMP accumulation, and ligand-gated ion channels) are not directly involved in the immediate release of glutamate upon electrical stimulation.

Answer: D",1450
602,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: Rifampin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, which metabolizes both estrogens and progestins in combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). This induction increases the clearance of these hormones, potentially rendering the OCPs less effective. The other options involve alterations in gastrointestinal flora or direct interference with absorption, which are not the primary mechanism of action for rifampin.

Answer: B",2156
603,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The lesion is hyperpigmented, painless, and nonpruritic, ruling out seborrheic keratosis and actinic keratosis, which are typically associated with itching and are more common in older individuals. A cherry hemangioma appears as a bright red, raised lesion and does not fit the description of a hyperpigmented papule. Dermatofibroma is characterized by a firm, dome-shaped nodule that can retract when squeezed, which matches the patient's description. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatofibroma.

Answer: A",1731
604,Complication: Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, rash, conjunctival injection, and involvement of the tongue and lips, which are classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease. The most common complications of Kawasaki disease include coronary artery aneurysms, which occur in up to 25% of untreated cases. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, hearing loss, and retinopathy are less commonly associated with Kawasaki disease. Therefore, the most common complication is coronary artery aneurysm.

Answer: A",2013
605,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient is described as acting very strangely, being anxious, and having delayed responses. These symptoms are consistent with stimulant intoxication, particularly cocaine, given the patient's anxiety and tachycardia. The presence of a dry mouth and conjunctival injection further supports this. While phencyclidine can cause similar symptoms, the patient's anxiety and tachycardia are more indicative of a stimulant like cocaine. Alcohol and marijuana intoxication would not typically present with such acute anxiety and tachycardia.

Answer: C",2413
606,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe abdominal pain and dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and adjacent transverse colon, suggesting ischemia. The hepatic colonic flexure and transverse colon are supplied by branches of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. The median sacral artery does not supply these regions. The inferior mesenteric artery primarily supplies the descending colon and sigmoid colon. The celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are more likely to supply the hepatic colonic flexure and transverse colon. Given the location of the symptoms, the celiac artery is the most probable source of arterial supply.

Answer: C",2079
607,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The context mentions that standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, indicating a comparison between observed and expected deaths. The overall SMR of 1.63 suggests that the observed mortality rate is higher than the expected rate. This aligns with the definition of SMRs as the observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.
Answer: C",2096
608,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient exhibits facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements, which are classic symptoms of metabolic encephalopathy associated with organic acidemias or purine metabolism disorders. The use of allopurinol, a drug used to manage hyperuricemia and gout, suggests a disorder involving purine metabolism. Given the patient's history of no teeth since early childhood and the current symptoms, the most likely biochemical pathway abnormality is a defect in purine metabolism, specifically hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT).

Answer: C",2480
609,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has poorly controlled Crohn disease, a history of intestinal obstruction, and fistula formation, indicating malabsorption issues. The presence of bullous, erythematous perioral plaques and hair loss suggests a nutritional deficiency. Niacin deficiency can cause dermatitis and alopecia, while iron deficiency typically causes diffuse hair thinning and pallor. Cobalamin deficiency usually presents with neurological symptoms and anemia rather than alopecia. Zinc deficiency can cause alopecia but is less commonly associated with perioral rashes. Given the context of malabsorption and the specific skin findings, niacin deficiency is the most likely cause.

Answer: A",1908
610,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of RhD negative blood and received a blood transfusion after a car accident. The anti-D antibody screen is negative, indicating no recent sensitization. Since the patient is RhD negative and the fetus is likely RhD positive (as the mother is RhD negative and the previous child was RhD positive), there is a risk of Rh incompatibility. However, the current anti-D antibody screen is negative, suggesting no sensitization during this pregnancy. Therefore, anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis is not necessary at this time. The patient should be monitored for any changes but no further antibody screening is needed until the 28th week of pregnancy as a standard protocol.

Answer: D",2244
611,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, particularly when lying down, palpitations, and pitting edema, which suggest heart failure. Jugular vein distention and an S3 gallop on auscultation are consistent with heart failure. The chest X-ray and ECG show no significant findings, ruling out hypertensive changes and other obvious structural heart issues. While parasitic infections can cause heart failure, the patient's emigration from Mexico and the lack of specific parasitic symptoms make this less likely. Alcohol abuse can lead to heart failure, but the patient does not report any history of alcohol use. Bacterial infections can cause heart failure, but the absence of fever, leukocytosis, and other systemic signs makes this less probable. 

Answer: A",2461
612,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral joint pain, fatigue, a subjective fever, and facial redness. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly given the facial rash (malar rash) and systemic symptoms. Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis, while decreased complement levels and increased anti-centromere and anti-topoisomerase antibodies are less likely based on the presented symptoms. 

Answer: C",2214
613,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive redness, pain, and a 'crunchy' sensation in the left thigh, along with systemic symptoms like fever and hypotension. These findings are consistent with a necrotizing soft tissue infection, specifically gas gangrene, which is caused by Clostridium perfringens or other anaerobic bacteria. Gas gangrene can produce free air in soft tissues seen on imaging, and the 'crunchy' sensation is due to the formation of gas within the tissue. 

The condition described is not typically associated with bacterial pneumonia, bacterial sinusitis, or urinary tract infections. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C",1924
614,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's ECG shows the absence of P-waves with an irregular RR complex, indicating atrial fibrillation (AFib). AFib increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to irregular blood flow in the atria. The new medication prescribed for the patient is likely to be an anticoagulant to prevent clot formation. Among the options, only the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors can explain the mechanism of action of anticoagulants like warfarin. Antithrombin activation and cyclooxygenase inhibition are not related to anticoagulation, and blocking glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors is used for platelet aggregation rather than anticoagulation.

Answer: C",3175
615,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of episodic neck stiffness and rotation suggest a possible dystonia or acute dystonic reaction, given his recent hospitalization for substance-induced psychosis and the administration of haloperidol. Benztropine is effective in treating these extrapyramidal side effects due to its anticholinergic properties. Physical therapy would be supportive but not the primary treatment. Dantrolene is used for malignant hyperthermia and severe muscle rigidity, not for dystonia. Baclofen is used for muscle spasticity but not specifically for dystonia. 

Answer: A",2287
616,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient initially presented with fevers, chills, and night sweats, which are nonspecific symptoms but could indicate an underlying infection or malignancy. The development of generalized swelling and proteinuria suggests a renal involvement. Among the given options, amyloidosis (Option B) can present with systemic symptoms like fever and can lead to renal impairment with proteinuria. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Option C) typically presents with nephrotic syndrome without significant systemic symptoms. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (Option A) usually presents acutely with hematuria and rapid decline in renal function. Minimal change disease (Option D) is usually associated with nephrotic syndrome without systemic symptoms. Given the systemic symptoms and the development of proteinuria, amyloidosis is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B",1770
617,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Ciprofloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase. The surviving colony would need a mechanism that directly counteracts this inhibition. Option A (replacement of D-alanine) and C (inactivation by bacterial transferase) do not directly relate to DNA gyrase activity. Option D (modification of surface binding proteins) could potentially affect drug binding but is less direct compared to altering enzyme function. Therefore, the most likely mechanism is a mutation affecting DNA gyrase itself.

Answer: B",1973
618,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a high fever, confusion, restlessness, agitation, and delusions of insects crawling on his skin. These symptoms suggest delirium tremens (DTs), a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. Chlorpromazine and haloperidol are both antipsychotics used to manage delirium tremens. However, diazepam is primarily used for anxiety and seizures, and clonidine is used for hypertension and withdrawal symptoms. Given the patient's delirious state, chlorpromazine or haloperidol would be appropriate. Between the two, haloperidol is more commonly used for acute management of delirium tremens.

Answer: D",2241
619,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, flatulence, and night-time vision problems. These symptoms suggest an issue with fat metabolism or digestion. The dry, scaly skin is consistent with a condition like steatorrhea, which can result from poor fat absorption. None of the neurotransmitter-related options (monoamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine) directly address fat metabolism or digestion issues. Lipase inhibition would reduce fat digestion, matching the symptoms of greasy diarrhea and poor skin condition. 

Answer: D",1514
620,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and is known to have hypertension. The diuretic mentioned blocks Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule, which is characteristic of loop diuretics like furosemide. Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide do not block these channels. Acetazolamide, while a diuretic, acts through a different mechanism and does not block Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. Therefore, the drug being referred to is furosemide.

Answer: A",1029
621,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of sickle cell disease and a surgically absent spleen, indicating hyposplenism. This condition increases the risk of severe infections, especially from encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. The presence of red streaks extending from the bite marks to the elbow suggests cellulitis or a spreading infection, which is consistent with a bacterial infection. 

- Human bites can cause infections but typically do not lead to widespread cellulitis.
- Fish bites are unlikely given the context and symptoms.
- Dog bites can be severe but do not typically cause the specific pattern of red streaks seen here.

The most concerning bite in this scenario is a spider bite, particularly from a brown recluse or another species known to cause necrotic lesions and systemic symptoms.

Answer: B",1872
622,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increasing weakness and clonus in both lower extremities, along with a positive family history of neurologic symptoms. The MRI of the brain is inconclusive, but the clinical presentation suggests a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The presence of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid is a common finding in MS, supporting the diagnosis.

Answer: C",2291
623,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: This study identifies individuals with and without interstitial lung disease and compares their exposure to the fire retardant chemical. It matches cases and controls based on age and geographic location and assesses exposure through surveys and home visits. This matches the definition of a case-control study, where two groups (cases and controls) are compared on the basis of a supposed causal attribute.

Answer: A",1536
624,Treatment,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has dilated pupils, dry skin, and tachycardia, which are signs of anticholinergic toxicity. Nortriptyline is an anticholinergic agent. Sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride are not indicated for anticholinergic toxicity. Naloxone is used to reverse opioid effects, and there is no indication of opioid involvement. Cyproheptadine, another antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can be used to manage anticholinergic toxicity.

Answer: B",1767
625,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient experienced an allergic reaction to the blood transfusion, indicating an immune response. Given the context of an unexpected allergic reaction and the need for epinephrine, it suggests an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, which is typically associated with high levels of IgE. The patient's history does not indicate any pre-existing conditions or known allergies, ruling out other immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, the expected finding would be high levels of IgE.

Answer: C",2275
626,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's presentation includes unconsciousness, track marks, large contusions, and tea-colored urine, indicating potential drug intoxication and overdose. The urine toxicology is positive for both opiates and cocaine, suggesting combined drug intoxication (CDI). The patient's high blood pressure and tachycardia, along with the presence of track marks, suggest intravenous drug use, which can lead to sepsis or endotoxemia, causing elevated creatine kinase levels. The other options do not align with the clinical scenario: low serum potassium, low blood urea nitrogen, and elevated serum calcium are less likely given the context.

Answer: D",2208
627,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing significant postpartum hemorrhage, defined as blood loss of more than 500 mL within the first 24 hours after delivery. Given the rapid decrease in blood pressure and the large volume of blood lost, immediate action is needed to control the bleeding. 

- **Hysterectomy** (A) is an extreme measure and not typically the first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage.
- **Intravenous oxytocin** (B) can help contract the uterus and reduce bleeding, but it may not be sufficient given the severity of the hemorrhage.
- **Elevate posterior fornix** (C) is a technique to locate the source of bleeding but does not address the underlying issue of excessive blood loss.
- **Red blood cell transfusion** (D) is indicated to rapidly replace lost blood volume and stabilize the patient’s hemodynamic status.

Answer: D",2084
628,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a BMI of 36.3 kg/m², indicating obesity, and transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver, which is consistent with fatty liver disease. He also has a history of smoking and intermittent alcohol use, both of which can contribute to liver issues. However, there is no evidence of autoimmune liver damage, congestive hepatopathy, or acetaminophen toxicity. The liver enzymes are mildly elevated, consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Given the patient's history of unsuccessful weight loss and metabolic risk factors, insulin resistance is a likely underlying cause.

Answer: C",2497
629,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient had a knee injury where the knee could be pushed posteriorly but not pulled anteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion. This suggests a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, as the PCL prevents posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. The other options do not fit the described mechanism of injury.

Answer: D",2114
630,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient has been off furosemide, leading to fluid retention and pulmonary edema. This results in increased Aa (alveolar-arterial) gradient due to impaired gas exchange in the presence of pulmonary edema. The decreased surface area for diffusion and increased diffusion distance are also common in pulmonary edema as alveoli fill with fluid, reducing the effective surface area for gas exchange.

Answer: C",2188
631,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, generalized weakness, and drenching night sweats are nonspecific but could be indicative of several conditions. However, the key finding is the presence of basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings, which are characteristic of Babesiosis. Additionally, the presence of parasitemia, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation further supports this diagnosis. Malaria typically presents with a different pattern of symptoms and does not usually present with these specific blood smear findings. Tuberculosis would not present with such acute symptoms and the blood smear findings. Lyme disease primarily presents with a characteristic rash and does not typically cause these hematological changes.

Answer: B",3037
632,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shortness of breath worse on left side lying down, a diastolic murmur that is prominent on left side, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary congestion. These findings suggest a left-sided heart issue. The presence of a mass in the left atrium attached to the septum on echocardiogram is highly indicative of an atrial myxoma, which can cause hemodynamic changes leading to the described symptoms. Rheumatic fever and innocent murmur are less likely given the specific findings, and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis typically presents with more systemic symptoms and less specific murmurs.

Answer: D",2140
633,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 25-year-old man with HIV infection and painless neck swelling. The presence of non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, in both anterior and posterior triangles of the neck is consistent with lymphadenopathy. Given the patient's HIV status, we need to consider HIV-related lymphadenopathy. The excisional biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis, but the clinical presentation aligns more with HIV-related lymphadenopathy rather than acute lymphoid leukemia, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, or phenytoin-induced adenopathy. Phenytoin-induced adenopathy typically presents as generalized lymphadenopathy without specific nodal involvement and is less likely given the localized lymphadenopathy. 

Answer: C",2800
634,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence, along with decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur, suggest potential autonomic neuropathy possibly due to diabetes mellitus. The presence of a systolic murmur could indicate underlying cardiovascular disease. Bethanechol can help improve bladder tone, and intermittent catheterization can manage urinary retention. However, given the patient's symptoms and the need for bladder control, bethanechol alone or combined with oxybutynin would be more appropriate than intermittent catheterization. Discontinuing diuretics or reducing fluid intake may worsen her condition.

Answer: B",2349
635,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include exertional dyspnea, nocturnal paroxysmal dyspnea, and a history of a previous myocardial infarction. These symptoms suggest left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. A stress test would help evaluate the functional capacity and identify any underlying ischemia, which could explain his symptoms. An echocardiogram provides detailed information about cardiac structure and function, but a stress test is more appropriate for assessing functional capacity and exercise tolerance. CT and cardiac biopsy are not indicated for initial evaluation of these symptoms.

Answer: C",2441
636,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 2-day-old preterm infant with a nonradiating continuous machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border, which is indicative of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Indomethacin can be used to close a PDA, thiazide diuretics are used for hypertension and edema, aspirin is used for antiplatelet therapy and prevention of thrombosis, and penicillin is used for bacterial infections. Given the context and the need to close the PDA, indomethacin is the most appropriate treatment.

Answer: A",1672
637,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The girl's symptoms include social anxiety (getting nervous around other children), difficulty understanding social cues, distractibility, and an intense focus on a single topic (marine biology). These align with schizoid personality disorder, characterized by a pattern of detachment from social relationships and limited emotional expression. 

- Option A: Boys are more commonly affected than girls - This is not specific to the given context.
- Option B: Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder - While distractibility is noted, it is not a core feature of schizoid personality disorder.
- Option C: Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder - There is no indication of intellectual disability in the context.
- Option D: Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age - The typical age of onset for schizoid personality disorder is adolescence or early adulthood, not 3-5 years.

Answer: B",1915
638,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has developed foul-smelling diarrhea, which suggests a pathogen that produces a strong odor. Stool cultures grew gram-positive, anaerobic rods, indicating a likely Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). CDI is known to be transmitted via spores, which are resistant to many common disinfectants. Chlorine-based solutions are effective against spores of C. difficile. Iodine-based, isopropanol-based, and quaternary amine-based solutions are less effective against spores.

Answer: A",1613
639,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The infant presents with lethargy, irritability, and hypotension, which are signs of hemolytic anemia. The elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin suggest ongoing red blood cell destruction. The Coombs test is negative, ruling out autoimmune hemolysis. The normal osmotic fragility gap rules out sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies. These findings point to a defect in red blood cell metabolism, specifically an enzyme that is allosterically inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which is known to regulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Answer: C",2274
640,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of lead poisoning, including abdominal cramps, muscle pains, and decreased activity. Lead levels in capillary and venous blood are elevated. The peripheral blood smear may show evidence of lead poisoning such as microcytic hypochromic anemia. Given these findings, the best treatment option is a chelating agent. Among the options, trientine, penicillamine, and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are chelators used for lead poisoning. However, trientine is specifically indicated for Wilson's disease and not typically used for lead poisoning. Penicillamine is also used for arsenic poisoning and not commonly for lead. DMSA (succimer) is a well-established chelator for lead poisoning. Therefore, the best treatment option is DMSA.

Answer: D",2392
641,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years. She now requires low-dose prednisone to manage her symptoms. Prednisone can cause bone density loss and increase the risk of fractures. Osgood-Schlatter disease is a condition affecting adolescents during growth spurts, not adults, and is not related to prednisone use. Therefore, the risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease is not relevant here.

Answer: A",2350
642,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is described as having severe shortness of breath, diminished chest wall movements, and an A-a gradient of 10 mm Hg. These findings suggest impaired gas exchange rather than a primary issue with blood flow. The A-a gradient being low (normal range is typically 10-15 mm Hg) indicates that the problem lies in the lungs rather than the heart or blood vessels. The use of sleeping pills by the patient could contribute to hypoventilation, leading to hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. This aligns with the description of alveolar hypoventilation.

Answer: A",1938
643,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient shows signs of cognitive decline and behavioral changes, including withdrawal and difficulty making eye contact. These symptoms suggest possible dementia. Given the patient's history of mild cognitive impairment and the son's frustration, discussing the situation with the son (Option A) is important but not the immediate next step. Completing a mini-mental exam (Option B) could provide more information but isn't necessary before addressing the current situation. Assessing the patient's risk for depression (Option C) is relevant but not the most immediate concern. Asking the son to step out (Option D) allows for a private conversation with the patient, which is crucial for accurate assessment and diagnosis.

Answer: D",1801
644,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Point D in the graph shows a decrease in stomach acid secretion and an increase in pH, indicating a reduction in acid production. D cells secrete somatostatin, which inhibits acid secretion and gastrin release. Therefore, increased activity of D cells would lead to the observed changes at point D.

Answer: B",1008
645,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a steadily increasing neck mass, which is hard and moves with swallowing. The ultrasound shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid, and the surgery specimen shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels. This suggests a poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, such as an anaplastic carcinoma or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, which often shows invasion of blood vessels and surrounding tissues. 

- Option A (Undifferentiated giant cells) is less common in thyroid cancers.
- Option C (Infiltration of atypical lymphoid tissue) is more indicative of lymphoma rather than thyroid cancer.
- Option D (Orphan Annie nuclei) is not a specific term used in pathology and is less likely to be seen in thyroid cancer.
- Option B (Capsular invasion) is consistent with the description of the tumor invading surrounding blood vessels and tissues.

Answer: B",2126
646,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The tumor grade refers to the cellular characteristics of the cancer, indicating how aggressive the cancer cells are compared to normal cells. The tumor stage, however, indicates the extent of cancer spread, which is crucial for determining prognosis. Age and location of the tumor do not provide information about the cancer's aggressiveness or spread. Therefore, the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis is the tumor stage.

Answer: B",1801
647,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 2-month-old with failure to gain weight, chronic diarrhea, and multiple infections. These symptoms are consistent with immunodeficiency. The absence of a thymic shadow and the lack of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy suggest severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Among the options, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a known cause of SCID, often presenting early with these symptoms. The other options (ATM gene defect, NADPH oxidase deficiency, and BTK gene defect) do not typically present with such a combination of symptoms in infancy.

Answer: B",1774
648,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a connective tissue disorder with impaired copper absorption and transport, along with dry, brittle hair. This suggests a defect in copper metabolism. ATP7A is involved in copper transport in the intestine, while ATP7B is involved in copper excretion in the liver and brain. FBN1 is associated with connective tissue disorders but does not directly affect copper transport. COL5A1 is related to collagen production and not copper transport. Given the symptoms and the genetic test results, the mutation is most likely in ATP7A.

Answer: A",1816
649,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a blind-ended vaginal pouch, no uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography, and sparse, lightly pigmented pubic hair. These findings suggest a diagnosis of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a congenital anomaly characterized by the absence of a uterus and vagina. The absence of a uterus and ovaries indicates that the gonads are present but not functional in terms of reproductive organs. Given the lack of secondary sexual characteristics and the presence of inguinal masses, it suggests the presence of functional testes, making testosterone therapy appropriate to induce secondary sexual characteristics and improve quality of life.

Answer: B",1503
650,"Contraindication
Contraindication would",True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of gastritis and is currently experiencing chest pain radiating to the neck and shoulder, along with anxiety and tachycardia. Aspirin can cause gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding, which could exacerbate his existing gastritis. ECG changes, hypercholesterolemia, and increased pulse rate do not inherently contraindicate the use of aspirin. Therefore, the most significant contraindication in this context is the patient's history of gastritis.

Answer: C",1922
651,Anemia,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, breathlessness during physical activity, and thinning hair, which are common symptoms of anemia. Given her history of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammation, she may have iron deficiency anemia, which is common in chronic inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency anemia leads to low ferritin levels and increased iron-binding capacity as the body tries to conserve iron. Therefore, the most likely finding on her iron profile is low ferritin levels.

Answer: B",2321
652,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with diarrhea, weakness, and electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia). Given her history of travel to the Bahamas and the presence of hypokalemia, there is a high suspicion for C. difficile infection or other enteric infections common in travelers. Performing a C. difficile toxin assay would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Answer: B",2310
653,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe right upper quadrant tenderness, fever, and elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance, indicating an inflammatory process. The ultrasound shows gallstones, which are a common cause of biliary obstruction leading to cholangitis. The symptoms and lab findings are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis rather than acute acalculous cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, or ascending cholangitis, which would typically present differently.

Answer: A",2914
654,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient has delayed menstruation, axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, indicating early signs of puberty. However, her FSH level is low (7 mIU/mL), which is not consistent with normal pubertal development where FSH should be elevated. Elevated testosterone levels (52 ng/dL) further support this. Hyperprolactinemia and Turner syndrome are less likely given the normal estradiol levels and the presence of secondary sexual characteristics. Muellerian agenesis would not explain the presence of secondary sexual characteristics. Androgen insensitivity syndrome fits the clinical presentation, explaining the hormonal imbalance and lack of normal menstrual cycle.

Answer: D",2769
655,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The space posterior to the stomach is the lesser sac, which can be accessed by cutting the hepatogastric ligament. However, none of the given options directly mention the hepatogastric ligament. Among the provided choices, the phrenoesophageal ligament is the one that connects the esophagus to the diaphragm and could potentially be involved in accessing the space posterior to the stomach. The gastrohepatic ligament and phrenicocolic ligament do not directly relate to the space posterior to the stomach. The ligamentum venosum is not relevant to this context.

Answer: A",1820
656,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, board-like rigidity, and positive rebound tenderness, which are classic signs of peritonitis. Vomiting with brown/red contents suggests hematemesis, which can be a sign of perforation in peptic ulcers. While peptic ulcers can cause pain, the presence of peritonitis points towards a perforated ulcer rather than just a simple peptic ulcer. Duodenal and gastric peptic ulcers are less likely to cause such severe signs of peritonitis. Pancreatitis typically presents with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting but does not usually cause peritonitis. 

Answer: D",1927
657,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of an ischemic stroke and now presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFib) on ECG, indicated by the irregular rate and rhythm. AFib increases the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. Given the patient's history of stroke and the presence of AFib, anticoagulation is necessary to prevent future CVAs. Aspirin alone is not sufficient for anticoagulation, and carotid endarterectomy is not indicated as there is no evidence of carotid artery stenosis. Clopidogrel is typically used in combination with aspirin for dual antiplatelet therapy, but not as a standalone for stroke prevention in this context. Warfarin and heparin are appropriate for anticoagulation in AFib.

Answer: D",3433
658,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The study involved comparing two groups of women who were BRCA-mutation positive: those with and without breast cancer. They looked at the surgical history of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to determine its association with breast cancer. This design involves retrospectively comparing cases (women with breast cancer) with controls (women without breast cancer) based on past exposure (surgical history). This matches the definition of a case-control study.
Answer: C",1830
659,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a well-controlled prostate cancer but also a pulmonary nodule measuring 3 cm. Pulmonary nodules of this size require careful evaluation due to the risk of malignancy. The 'popcorn' pattern, subsolid component, and extending fine striations are concerning for malignancy. However, a doubling time of less than 1 month is more indicative of a benign process like infection or inflammation rather than a rapidly growing malignancy. Given the context of a 3-cm nodule, the most concerning finding would be a subsolid component, which is a strong indicator of malignancy.

Answer: B",2304
660,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's primary complaint is insomnia, which is affecting his health and financial concerns. He exhibits excessive worry about his health and ability to pay bills, which aligns with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The patient's irritability and tension during the interview further support this diagnosis. There is no indication of an adjustment disorder, social anxiety, or normal worry based on the provided information. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is GAD.

Answer: A",2488
661,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a membranous ventricular septal defect and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, indicating significant cardiac involvement. A continuous murmur would be more indicative of a patent ductus arteriosus or coarctation of the aorta, which is not mentioned here. A diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap suggests mitral valve prolapse or regurgitation, which is also not indicated by the given information. A systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching is common in ventricular septal defects due to increased blood flow through the defect during Valsalva maneuver. However, the question specifies a systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis, which is more characteristic of a pulmonary stenosis or other obstructive lesions, not a ventricular septal defect.

Answer: B",1879
662,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient's recent travel to Southeast Asia, fever, cough, and weight loss suggest a possible infectious etiology, such as tuberculosis (TB). The left lung base findings (dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus) are consistent with consolidation or pleural involvement, which can occur in TB. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:
- Elevation of diaphragm is more common in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Ground glass appearance is seen in conditions like pneumonia or interstitial lung disease.
- Widened intercostal spaces are seen in conditions like emphysema.
Answer: B",2319
663,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden-onset right-sided body numbness, which suggests a lesion affecting sensory pathways. The decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side indicates a sensory deficit. The motor strength is intact (5/5) and deep tendon reflexes are only slightly reduced (2+ bilaterally), suggesting a primarily sensory deficit rather than a motor one. The basilar part of the pons is involved in sensory pathways but does not directly correspond to the described symptoms. The posterior limb of the internal capsule and lateral medulla can cause similar sensory deficits but are more commonly associated with motor deficits as well. The ventral thalamus can cause contralateral sensory deficits but is less likely given the specific localization to the right side. Therefore, the most likely structure involved is the basal pons, which is responsible for sensory integration.

Answer: C",2085
664,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with multiple petechiae and bruising, which are characteristic of easy bruising. The coagulation profile shows a normal prothrombin time (PT) but an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), indicating a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. This finding is consistent with Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), where the aPTT is typically prolonged due to the presence of antibodies against coagulation factors, particularly factor VIII. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia would present with more systemic symptoms and abnormalities in both PT and aPTT. Von Willebrand disease would show a prolonged PT and aPTT, and Hemophilia A would primarily affect the aPTT with a normal PT.

Answer: B",1795
665,Treatment,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a painless lump near the wrist with decreased sensation to pinprick over the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger, suggesting ulnar nerve involvement. The mass is transilluminating and fixed, consistent with a ganglion cyst. Ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist (Guyon's canal) can cause similar symptoms. The ulnar nerve is at risk for entrapment adjacent to this mass.

Answer: D",2066
666,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a painless, cystic, and transilluminating mass in the right scrotum that does not increase in size on coughing and can be palpated above the mass. These findings suggest a hydrocele, which is caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis. The mass does not extend into the inguinal canal, ruling out an inguinal hernia. There are no signs of venous dilation in the pampiniform plexus. Therefore, the most likely cause is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.

Answer: A",2202
667,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has signs of compartment syndrome, indicated by pain upon palpation, swelling, decreased sensation, inability to move the leg, absence of pulses, coldness, and pallor. Measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg further confirms the diagnosis. Immediate decompression is necessary to prevent permanent nerve and muscle damage. Venous Doppler and arteriogram are diagnostic tools but not immediate interventions. External fixation is used for fractures, not for compartment syndrome.

Answer: A",1896
668,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is an 18-month-old with a fever and a pruritic rash starting on the trunk and progressing to the face and extremities. This presentation is consistent with chickenpox (varicella), which typically begins on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities. Nonbullous impetigo usually presents as non-blistering lesions and is less likely to start on the trunk. Rubella typically presents with a more generalized rash but does not usually start on the trunk. Fifth disease (erythema infectiosum) starts with a bright red rash on the cheeks and then spreads to the rest of the body, but it does not usually present with a pruritic rash on the trunk first.

Answer: B",1405
669,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, consistent with a Mallory-Weiss tear. Given his history of alcohol abuse and current intoxication, conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation is appropriate to prevent further bleeding. Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding are typically used for active bleeding, esophageal manometry and impedance studies are diagnostic tools not indicated in acute management, and calcium channel blockers and Botox injections are not standard treatments for Mallory-Weiss tears.

Answer: B",1818
670,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: Chlorhexidine is known for its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. It works by disrupting the cell membrane, leading to leakage of cellular contents and ultimately cell death. This mechanism does not involve free radical release, pH dependence, or specific targeting of sulfur-containing compounds. Therefore, the best description of chlorhexidine's mechanism of action is that it is bactericidal at low concentrations.

Answer: A",1269
671,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with pruritis and an erythematous, well-demarcated patch on his left thigh, pubic region, and perineum. This pattern is consistent with tinea cruris, which affects the skin in the groin area. Tinea corporis typically affects the arms and legs but not specifically the inguinal region. Candidal balanitis would present with more involvement of the scrotum and is usually associated with moisture and yeast infections. Tinea unguium affects the nails, which is not the case here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is tinea cruris.

Answer: B",1727
672,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: At 6 weeks of age, the female infant's reproductive system is still in its early stages of development. Oocytes begin to form before birth but are not fully matured until puberty. Therefore, the oocytes are not fully matured at this stage.

Answer: D",1902
673,Prevention,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include burning sensation in the mouth, mouth ulcers, and darkening of the skin, which suggest a condition like dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The absence of central pallor in the peripheral blood smear and the enlarged spleen are consistent with chronic inflammation. The father's history of gallstones also supports celiac disease, which can present with these symptoms. Red blood cell transfusions, vitamin B12 injections, and folic acid supplementation do not address the underlying gluten sensitivity. A gluten-free diet, however, can prevent the oropharyngeal symptoms by eliminating gluten from the diet.

Answer: B",2012
674,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The new experimental drug prevents the degradation of incretins at the endothelium, increasing glucose-dependent insulin production. Sitagliptin works by inhibiting DPP-IV, which degrades GLP-1, thus increasing GLP-1 levels and enhancing insulin secretion. Glimepiride increases insulin secretion directly but requires functional pancreatic beta cells. Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, and pioglitazone is a PPARγ agonist, neither of which affect incretin levels. 

Answer: A",1400
675,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of severe persistent asthma and recently developed nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. This suggests a loss of asthma control. Among the options, airway epithelial shedding and airway smooth muscle atrophy are less likely to directly cause the recent symptoms. Airway hyperresponsiveness can lead to increased symptoms with minimal triggers, fitting the recent exacerbation. Airway remodeling typically occurs over a longer period and is not the most immediate cause of recent symptoms.

Answer: D",1864
676,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a productive cough, shortness of breath, and crackles over both lung fields, indicating pneumonia. The presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae confirms the bacterial infection. Given the patient's age and the rapid progression despite appropriate therapy leading to death, the lesion likely represents a severe inflammatory response. Among the options, platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotriene D4 (LTD4) are potent inflammatory mediators that can cause significant lung inflammation and edema. However, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, which would not be expected to cause the observed inflammatory response. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is pro-inflammatory and can contribute to the inflammatory process seen in pneumonia. Given the context of severe inflammation and the presence of crackles, PAF or LTD4 are more likely. However, PAF is more directly associated with the acute inflammatory response and vascular permeability changes, making it the most likely mediator.

Answer: A",1862
677,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with multiple bruises and a subconjunctival hemorrhage, which could indicate non-accidental trauma. Given the history of a fall from a changing table, the possibility of child abuse should be considered. The most immediate and appropriate initial step is to involve social services to ensure the safety of the child and investigate the circumstances of the injuries.

Answer: B",2284
678,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The study involves randomizing participants to different treatment groups (nitrofurantoin for 5 or 7 days and cefpodoxime for 5 or 7 days) and comparing outcomes. Each participant is assigned to one group, and there is no clustering or group-level randomization. This matches the definition of a parallel study, where participants are randomly assigned to different interventions without crossover.

Answer: A",2509
679,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with acute onset neck pain and enlargement, along with fatigue and cold intolerance. These symptoms are not typical of iodine deficiency or HLA-B8 risk factor. The presence of a painful, diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with nodules and diffuse cellular hyperplasia with focal colloid hyperplasia suggests a benign condition rather than an embryological remnant or fibroinflammatory proliferation. The most likely diagnosis is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and thyroid hyperplasia.

Answer: C",2106
680,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include extreme fatigue and yellow skin, indicating jaundice. His ALT level is elevated to 2,000 IU/L, which is highly indicative of liver inflammation or damage. The hepatitis viral panel shows HBsAg positive and IgM anti-HBc positive, which are strong indicators of acute hepatitis B infection. There is no evidence of past infection (anti-HBs positive would indicate immunity), acute hepatitis A (Anti-HAV IgM negative), or co-infection with hepatitis D (Anti-HDV negative). Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute hepatitis B.

Answer: D",1978
681,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a past spontaneous abortion, and current symptoms consistent with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), including a positive Homan's sign, thrombus in the left popliteal vein, and abnormal coagulation tests (prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and mixing study). The mixing study result being prolonged suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway, which is characteristic of APS. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation: platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibodies are associated with thrombocytopenia, endothelial cell antibodies are less commonly associated with thrombosis, and vitamin K deficiency would not typically present with thrombosis but rather bleeding issues.

Answer: B",2712
682,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include worsening shortness of breath, frequent pneumonia, greenish sputum with blood, fever, and brown mucous plugs. These symptoms suggest a chronic lung condition with superimposed infection. The presence of ""glove-finger shadows"" on chest radiography indicates bronchiectasis, a condition characterized by abnormal, permanent widening of the airways. The elevated IgE levels also support an allergic component. Isoniazid is used for tuberculosis, fluconazole for candidiasis, and caspofungin for fungal infections, none of which fit the clinical presentation. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, can help reduce inflammation and control exacerbations in conditions like bronchiectasis.

Answer: D",2591
683,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with high fever, diarrhea, hypotension, interstitial lung infiltrates, metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. These findings are consistent with a severe systemic infection, such as sepsis. The gram stain from the autopsy specimen shows gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This organism is known to cause severe pneumonia and sepsis, fitting the clinical presentation. Staphylococcus aureus can also cause sepsis but does not typically present with these specific findings. Streptococcus pyogene is associated with strep throat and skin infections but not with the described lung infiltrates and systemic findings. Non-typeable H. influenzae is less commonly associated with severe systemic infections like those seen here.

Answer: C",2902
684,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, facial and lip swelling, and tender abdominal findings. These symptoms are consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The abdominal ultrasound showing segmental thickening of the intestinal wall suggests involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, which is common in anaphylaxis. The history of previous episodes following trauma (tooth extraction and bicycle accident) supports a pattern of allergic reactions. Among the given options, mast-cell activation is the most likely mechanism for anaphylaxis, as it directly involves the release of mediators like histamine leading to the observed symptoms.

Answer: D",2027
685,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The dotted line in the graph represents the point where no further change in lung volume occurs despite increases in transpulmonary pressure. This indicates the lung volume at which the elastic recoil forces of the lungs and chest wall are in equilibrium, which is the definition of functional residual capacity (FRC). Inspiratory capacity, tidal volume, and total lung capacity do not represent this equilibrium point.

Answer: C",1658
686,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with low serum glucose, high serum ammonia, and orotic aciduria, which are consistent with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. This condition leads to hyperammonemia due to impaired urea cycle. The orotic aciduria indicates a defect in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Among the given options, the enzyme involved in the reaction catalyzing the conversion of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline is directly affected in this condition.

Answer: A",1336
687,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dragging pelvic pain and significant weight loss, which are concerning symptoms for ovarian cancer. The adnexal mass on ultrasound is 6 cm, which is large enough to suggest a solid tumor, consistent with ovarian cancer. Stromal cells are the most common type of cell in the ovary and can form tumors. Germ cells and chorionic epithelial cells are not typically found in the ovaries, and endometrial cells are not associated with ovarian tumors. Therefore, the most likely origin of the adnexal mass is stromal cells.

Answer: D",2204
688,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms, including severe pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, are consistent with gout. Needle-shaped birefringent crystals observed in the synovial fluid confirm the presence of monosodium urate crystals. The patient's history of chronic smoking and binge drinking supports a high purine diet, which can elevate uric acid levels. The other options (organic acids, increased renal reabsorption, and HGPRT deficiency) do not directly explain the crystal formation or the patient's symptoms.

Answer: D",3030
689,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a positive RPR and FTA-ABS, indicating syphilis infection. Given his CD4 count of 175, which is within the range of advanced HIV, the risk of neurosyphilis is higher. However, the neurological examination is normal, and there are no symptoms suggesting CNS involvement. Therefore, a lumbar puncture is not immediately necessary. Penicillin therapy is indicated for syphilis, but the frequency and duration depend on the stage of syphilis. Since the patient has early syphilis (indicated by a positive RPR), three weekly injections of penicillin are appropriate. The titers should be checked in 3 months to assess treatment response.

Answer: B",1595
690,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient's metabolic and lipid profile shows worsening parameters, including increased triglycerides and decreased HDL with a smaller increase in LDL. This pattern suggests treatment with a fibrate class drug like gemfibrozil, which is known to lower triglycerides and slightly increase HDL. Fibrate drugs can cause hepatotoxicity as a side effect, making option C a plausible concern. Cholelithiasis (option A) and decreased vitamin D absorption (option B) are less commonly associated with fibrates. Teratogenicity (option D) is not typically a concern with fibrates. Therefore, the most likely side effect is hepatotoxicity.

Answer: C",1551
691,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder where phenylalanine levels must be kept low to prevent intellectual disability and other complications in the fetus. The patient's current plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL is significantly elevated, indicating poor dietary compliance. Starting a restricted diet only in the first trimester would be too late to effectively manage phenylalanine levels. However, beginning the diet 3 months prior to conception can help ensure that phenylalanine levels are within safe limits before pregnancy begins. This reduces the risk of fetal morbidity associated with high phenylalanine levels.

Answer: B",1672
692,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset severe eye pain and redness, progressive lower back pain, heel pain, and pressure while walking. These symptoms suggest a systemic inflammatory condition rather than localized issues like aortic regurgitation or dry mouth. Elevated ESR and CRP levels indicate inflammation. Malabsorption typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms and nutritional deficiencies, not ocular or musculoskeletal symptoms. Hemochromatosis primarily affects the liver and joints but does not typically cause sudden eye pain. The combination of systemic symptoms and inflammatory markers points towards an autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis.

Answer: A",2127
693,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient experiences recurrent episodes of chest pain that occur at random times, including during sleep and while performing daily activities. This pattern is consistent with exertional angina, which can be managed with nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate. Aspirin is used for antiplatelet therapy but does not directly relieve anginal symptoms. Heparin is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots, not for acute angina relief. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can reduce anginal episodes but is not typically the first-line treatment for this presentation without hypertension or hyperthyroidism. Isosorbide dinitrate is effective for both heart failure and angina, making it the best choice for this patient's symptoms.

Answer: B",2327
694,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with infectious mononucleosis, including fever, sore throat, fatigue, splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy. The presence of atypical lymphocytes and a positive heterophile antibody screen further supports this diagnosis. Ganciclovir is used for CMV infections, amoxicillin is an antibiotic for bacterial infections, and prednisone is used for inflammation. There is no indication for these treatments in infectious mononucleosis. Bed rest and activity limitation are appropriate supportive measures but do not address the underlying viral infection.

Answer: A",1604
695,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and signs of dehydration (low blood pressure, dizziness, and skin turgor). The high serum sodium (150 mEq/L) and low chloride (97 mEq/L) suggest an osmotic imbalance. The high urine osmolality (400 mOsm/kg) compared to the serum osmolality (354 mOsm/kg) indicates osmotic diuresis. The high hemoglobin A1C (10.5%) suggests poorly controlled diabetes, which can lead to osmotic diuresis due to glucose in the urine. 

Answer: B",2709
696,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a fasting blood glucose of 120 mg/dL and a two-hour post-load glucose level of 190 mg/dL, indicating impaired glucose tolerance. This suggests the need to increase insulin sensitivity. Catecholamines typically increase blood glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, Glucagon raises blood glucose by promoting glycogen breakdown, and Glucocorticoids increase blood glucose by inhibiting insulin action. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is known to enhance insulin sensitivity by promoting adipocyte differentiation and increasing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.

Answer: D",1992
697,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with hemoptysis and hematuria, along with RBC casts and bilateral pulmonary consolidation. These findings are consistent with Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease where antibodies target the glomerular basement membrane and lung capillaries, leading to both pulmonary and renal involvement. The presence of RBC casts and the rapid progression suggest an autoimmune etiology, making anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies the most likely cause.

Answer: D",1759
698,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include difficulty concentrating, fatigue, decreased appetite, and loss of interest in activities he previously enjoyed. These are consistent with major depressive disorder. However, given his history of returning from a deployment to Afghanistan, PTSD should be considered. While adjustment disorder can cause similar symptoms, the chronic nature of the symptoms and the specific history of trauma suggest PTSD is more likely. Acute stress disorder typically resolves within a few days to weeks, which does not fit the timeline here.

Answer: D",1881
699,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with double vision, bilateral ptosis, and worsening symptoms in the evening. These symptoms suggest a neuromuscular disorder affecting the ocular muscles. Pyridostigmine is used for myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular disorders, which could explain the ptosis and double vision. Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and would not be the first-line treatment for this presentation. Hydrocortisone is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and would not directly address the neuromuscular issue. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant and would be more appropriate for autoimmune conditions rather than a direct neuromuscular disorder.

Answer: A",1684
700,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin, an anticoagulant. The irregular pulse and minor limp suggest possible thromboembolic events or bleeding complications. Given her warfarin therapy, monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) is crucial to ensure proper anticoagulation and prevent both overtreatment and undertreatment. Echocardiogram and partial thromboplastin time are not directly related to warfarin management, and serum drug levels are not typically ordered for warfarin. 

Answer: B",3002
701,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has significant overweight, hypogonadism, and delayed cognitive and social milestones. These symptoms suggest a condition like Prader-Willi syndrome, which is often associated with hyperphagia due to elevated levels of ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates appetite. Ghrelin is primarily produced by G cells in the stomach. Therefore, the elevated gastrointestinal hormone causing the weight gain is produced in G cells.
Answer: B",1772
702,Sensitivity,False,D,C,"Reasoning: Lowering the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm would increase the number of positive results, thereby increasing the likelihood of identifying more true cases of TB. This directly impacts the test's ability to correctly identify those without the condition (specificity) rather than the relationship between similar measures (convergent validity), dissimilar measures (discriminant validity), or the proportion of true negatives among negative results (negative predictive value).

Answer: D",1544
703,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with jaundice, severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, and elevated alkaline phosphatase, which suggests a possible biliary obstruction. The context does not provide information related to ovarian cancer (CA 125), muscle-specific proteins (Desmin), or breast cancer (CA 27-29). CA 19-9 is specifically used in the management of pancreatic cancer, which aligns with the presentation of biliary obstruction and abdominal pain. 

Answer: D",2443
704,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The infant's skin appears yellow, which suggests jaundice. This symptom is not consistent with porphyria, which typically presents with abdominal pain, confusion, and other neurological symptoms. Plasmapheresis is used to treat certain autoimmune disorders and is not indicated for neonatal jaundice. Switching from breast milk to formula would not address the underlying cause of jaundice. Breastfeeding should continue as it provides adequate nutrition and antibodies to the infant. Therefore, the best treatment is to continue normal breast feeding.

Answer: D",2792
705,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of urinary leakage during activities like laughing or coughing, along with increased frequency of urination, suggest stress urinary incontinence. The Valsalva maneuver causing leakage supports this diagnosis. Diabetes and polyuria/polydipsia would typically present with increased thirst and frequent urination, which are not mentioned. Primary polydipsia would also lead to increased fluid intake but without the specific urinary leakage. A vescicovaginal fistula would present with more severe symptoms and abnormal findings on pelvic examination. Urethral hypermobility fits best with the described symptoms.

Answer: C",2292
706,Treatment,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with an episode of altered mental status, confusion, and a positive toxicology screen for benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine overdose can cause confusion, drowsiness, and even coma. The urine dipstick shows dark appearance and positive red blood cells, which could indicate hematuria possibly due to benzodiazepine-induced hypotension or trauma from falling. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine and would worsen the condition. IV fluids and mannitol are used for acute hypertensive episodes or intracranial hemorrhage, not indicated here. Phenytoin is used for seizure prophylaxis and is not indicated for benzodiazepine overdose. Supportive therapy and observation are necessary while monitoring for any changes in the patient's condition.

Answer: D",2528
707,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration and dry mucous membranes and slightly sunken eyes. These symptoms suggest significant fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance, particularly sodium depletion. The proximal tubule is responsible for the majority of sodium reabsorption in the nephron, typically around 65-70% of filtered sodium. Given the patient's symptoms and the early stage of her condition, the primary site of sodium reabsorption would be in the proximal tubule before significant losses occur.

Answer: C",2367
708,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a one-week-old with severe jaundice, hepatomegaly, and neurological symptoms such as lethargy and decreased muscle tone. The high level of unconjugated bilirubin (29.2 mg/dL) and the absence of conjugated bilirubin suggest a defect in bilirubin conjugation rather than excretion. This points towards a deficiency in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1, which is responsible for converting unconjugated bilirubin into its conjugated form for excretion. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation.

Answer: A",2018
709,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The context provided does not directly relate to the question about the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea. However, we can infer that the correct answer must be one of the given letters (B, C, D, or E). Since the graph in figure A is not provided, we cannot make specific calculations. Given the options, we need to select the most logical choice based on typical ratios observed in the proximal convoluted tubule, where urea is actively reabsorbed. 

Answer: B",1583
710,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which can lead to malabsorption issues. The presence of envelope-shaped crystals in the urinalysis suggests calcium oxalate stones, which are common in conditions associated with hypercalciuria or hyperoxaluria. The father's history of recurrent kidney stones also points to a genetic predisposition. Parathyroid gland adenoma and excess vitamin D would typically present with hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels, not specifically with oxalate stones. High urine pH generally prevents calcium oxalate stone formation. Therefore, the most likely contributing factor is malabsorption of fatty acids from Crohn's disease.

Answer: C",1774
711,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has generalized fine scales and coarse skin, which are characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris. The absence of itching, redness, or discharge, along with the seasonal variation in severity, further supports this diagnosis. Psoriasis typically presents with well-defined plaques and may be associated with itching or pustules. Lichen simplex chronicus involves itching and scratching, leading to thickened, leathery skin. Tinea versicolor causes hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches, often on the trunk and proximal extremities, which does not match the patient's presentation.

Answer: C",1616
712,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has antepartum bleeding and a tender, bruised cervix with no signs of placental separation or rupture. The bleeding started after resuming sexual activity, suggesting a possible cause related to the cervix rather than the placenta. The placenta is described as uniformly echogenic and located away from the cervix, reducing the likelihood of placental abruption. The cervix being tender and bruised points towards an injury or inflammation rather than a pedunculated growth. 

Answer: C",1915
713,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including high blood glucose, metabolic acidosis, dehydration, and elevated respiratory rate due to compensatory hyperventilation. The presence of ketone bodies in the urine and the fruity breath odor (ketosis) further supports this diagnosis. The most urgent need is to correct the metabolic acidosis and manage the hyperglycemia, which can be achieved by administering IV fluids and insulin. 

Answer: A",2060
714,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include excruciating chest pain that is ripping and radiating to the back, along with hypotension and weak distal pulses. These symptoms are highly suggestive of aortic dissection, a condition often associated with a heart murmur. The presence of a heart murmur in a young patient with joint hypermobility further supports this diagnosis. An aortic dissection can present with a wide range of murmurs, but the most common is a continuous, high-pitched bruit heard best at the lower left sternal border. This corresponds to option A.

Answer: A",2701
715,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The episodes described involve the child screaming and crying uncontrollably during the night without any confusion or lethargy afterward, and the absence of any response when questioned. This pattern is characteristic of sleep terror disorder (night terrors), where the child experiences intense fear and arousal during sleep but has no memory of the event upon waking. Night terrors do not persist into adulthood, occur during REM sleep, and are not directly linked to child abuse or the development of mood disorders. Therefore, none of the given options accurately describe the episodes.

Answer: A",2112
716,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient developed a pruritic rash shortly after starting ceftriaxone for pyelonephritis. This suggests an allergic reaction rather than direct tissue damage from the antibiotic itself (Option A), cytotoxic T-cell destruction (Option B), or mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues (Option D). The hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature (Option C) is more commonly associated with vasodilatory conditions like urticaria or angioedema, which do not fit the context of a sudden onset pruritic rash after starting an antibiotic. Therefore, the most likely cause is an allergic reaction leading to hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature.

Answer: C",1427
717,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra, which is often associated with osteoporosis or secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) are key factors. SHPT is common in chronic kidney disease and leads to increased bone resorption and fractures. The other options are less likely: primary hyperparathyroidism typically presents with hypercalcemia, which is not present here; tertiary hyperparathyroidism usually follows surgical removal of parathyroid tissue; and elder abuse would not explain the specific fracture pattern.

Answer: B",2631
718,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral leg swelling and a recent diagnosis of hypertension. The key is identifying the new medication that could cause edema. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, can cause edema as a side effect. Losartan, while effective for hypertension, does not commonly cause edema. Spironolactone can cause edema but is less commonly used as a first-line agent for hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, is used to reduce edema rather than cause it. Therefore, the most likely cause of edema in this patient is amlodipine.

Answer: D",2033
719,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) is involved in the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis. Elevated levels suggest a focus on glycolytic pathway efficiency. Among the given options, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and carbonic anhydrase are not directly related to the glycolytic pathway or BPGM function. However, glutathione reductase is crucial for maintaining the reducing environment of the cell, independent of glycolysis. Its absence would not directly correlate with elevated BPGM levels. Therefore, the most likely absent enzyme is carbonic anhydrase, as it is not directly involved in glycolysis or BPGM function.

Answer: D",1114
720,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of close encounters with cars and unexpected shirt wetting suggests a condition where she experiences sudden surges of adrenaline or other stress hormones. This is indicative of hyperthyroidism, which can elevate thyroid hormones like thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Elevated thyroid hormones can cause increased sweating (leading to wet shirts) and anxiety-like symptoms (close encounters with cars).

- Decreased oxytocin: Oxytocin is not directly related to the symptoms described.
- Decreased progesterone: Progesterone levels do not typically correlate with the described symptoms.
- Increased follicle-stimulating hormone: FSH is not directly linked to the symptoms.
- Increased progesterone: Progesterone levels do not typically correlate with the described symptoms.

Answer: C",1787
721,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include episodic headaches, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, which suggest increased intracranial pressure. The MRI shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle, indicating obstruction of CSF flow. The arachnoid villi drain CSF from the subarachnoid space into the venous system, not directly affecting the lateral ventricles. The interventricular foramen connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle, not causing lateral ventricle dilation. The median aperture (Magendie foramen) is located between the fourth ventricle and the cisterna magna, not affecting the lateral ventricles. The lateral apertures (Luschka foramina) allow CSF to flow from the lateral ventricles to the subarachnoid space, and their obstruction can lead to lateral ventricle dilation.

Answer: D",1594
722,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The child presents with lethargy, easy bruising, and petechiae, which are classic signs of vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors, and deficiency can lead to bleeding disorders such as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. The mother's report of decreased feeding and the child's low blood pressure further support this diagnosis. Other conditions like GBS infection or hepatitis B would typically present with more specific symptoms not matching these findings. Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency is unlikely given the absence of thyroid-related symptoms.

Answer: D",2173
723,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a generalized, non-itchy rash, fever, sore throat, pharyngeal erythema, and a red beefy tongue. These symptoms are characteristic of Kawasaki disease, which requires immediate treatment to prevent coronary artery aneurysms. Encephalitis, mitral valve regurgitation, and minimal change disease do not match the clinical presentation. Therefore, the greatest risk without treatment is coronary artery aneurysms.

Answer: A",1998
724,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, nausea, vomiting, and a high white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid (175/mm³), which suggests a central nervous system infection. The low glucose level (49 mg/dL) and elevated protein level (55 mg/dL) further support this. The CSF findings are consistent with viral meningitis, given the history of recent illness and the presence of a viral infection like herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Acyclovir is the standard treatment for these viral infections affecting the central nervous system.

Answer: A",3187
725,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include a sore mouth without pain during swallowing, and he has a history of asthma. The oral mucosa appearance and examination findings do not suggest a fungal infection or severe skin condition. Isotretinoin is used for skin conditions and not for oral symptoms. Penicillin V is used for bacterial infections but does not address the specific oral symptom. Nystatin is commonly used for oral candidiasis, which could explain the sore mouth. Given the context, the most appropriate next step is to rule out a fungal infection.

Answer: C",2334
726,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI), including fever, chills, flank pain, and tenderness in the costovertebral area. The urine cultures grew a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. Gram-negative rods that fit these characteristics include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is known to produce pyoverdine, a siderophore involved in iron acquisition. None of the other options (lipoteichoic acid, K capsule, or Toxin B) are associated with gram-negative rods. Therefore, the most likely substance produced by the causal organism is pyoverdine.

Answer: D",1580
727,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms, including episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, suggest a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. The presence of mediastinal masses and the typical histopathological findings in Hodgkin lymphoma include Reed-Sternberg cells, which express CD15 and CD30. The other options are less likely: BCR-ABL rearrangement is seen in chronic myeloid leukemia, Bcl-2 overexpression is seen in Burkitt lymphoma, and t(8;14) chromosomal translocation is seen in Burkitt lymphoma. 

Answer: A",2208
728,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with early pregnancy, including nausea, increased urinary frequency, fatigue, and breast tenderness. The crown-rump length (CRL) is the most accurate predictor of gestational age during the first trimester, specifically around the time of the missed period. Other measurements like head to abdominal circumference, femoral length, and biparietal length are more relevant later in pregnancy.

Answer: C",1647
729,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 6-week-old male with recurrent nonbilious vomiting occurring immediately after feeds, irritability during feeding, and an epigastric mass. These symptoms suggest a possible congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS), given the presence of an epigastric mass consistent with a hypertrophied pylorus. CHPS is characterized by a thickened pyloric muscle leading to obstruction, often presenting with projectile vomiting and an epigastric mass. The other options are less likely: rotavirus infection typically presents with bilious vomiting and diarrhea, a dilated colon is not typical for CHPS, and the ""triple bubble"" sign is seen in duodenal atresia, not CHPS.

Answer: C",2533
730,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with photophobia, bilateral lacrimation, eye itching, and eyelid swelling, which are classic symptoms of conjunctivitis. Given the history of an allergy to cephalosporins, a third-generation cephalosporin would not be appropriate. Topical bacitracin is used for bacterial infections, not viral or allergic conjunctivitis. Oral tetracycline is used for chlamydial conjunctivitis, which is not indicated here. Azithromycin is used for chlamydial conjunctivitis and can be given orally, making it a suitable option if the cause is suspected to be chlamydial.

Answer: D",2074
731,t(9;22),True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is a 9-year-old boy with t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, which is associated with a poor prognosis. While fever and neutropenia indicate an increased risk of infection, they do not directly indicate a poor prognosis. The age of the patient is generally favorable, and the initial presentation does not provide information about the specific subtype of leukemia. However, the presence of t(9;22) (Philadelphia chromosome) is a strong indicator of a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Answer: B",1859
732,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive neck pain, headaches, and numbness in both hands, along with recurrent gout. These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, given the history of intravenous drug use and the inflammatory findings on MRI and bone biopsy. Blood cultures are pending, which would confirm the diagnosis if positive. Lumbar puncture is indicated to analyze cerebrospinal fluid for signs of meningitis. Other options like antibiotics (B) are premature without confirmed diagnosis, indomethacin (C) is not specific, and bone scintigraphy (D) is not relevant to the current presentation.

Answer: A",3287
733,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability, along with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. These symptoms suggest a condition like hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, which can lead to significant dehydration and metabolic acidosis due to poor absorption and frequent vomiting. The olive-shaped mass is characteristic of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. There is no indication of respiratory changes or respiratory alkalosis based on the clinical presentation. Therefore, the acid-base disturbance is most likely related to the underlying condition rather than respiratory factors.

Answer: B",2426
734,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 10-year-old girl with HIV and is on HAART with a suppressed viral load. However, she still has symptoms such as difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers, along with oral ulcers. These symptoms suggest an opportunistic infection rather than a failure of antiretroviral therapy. The CD4 count is low (100/mm³), indicating advanced HIV disease, which can lead to immune system failure despite effective antiretroviral therapy. 

- Option A (Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity) is less likely because CD8 cells are crucial for controlling viral replication, and the viral load is already suppressed.
- Option B (env gene mutation) and Option C (pol gene mutation) are unlikely because the viral load is low, suggesting the virus is still replicating efficiently.
- Option D (Decreased viral replication) is incorrect given the low viral load.

Answer: C",2422
735,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include confusion, somnolence, polyuria, and weight loss, which suggest a potential hyperparathyroidism or secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency or low calcium levels. The PTH level is within the normal range, but the symptoms point towards a condition that might benefit from increasing bone formation and reducing the risk of fractures. Alendronate and calcitonin are used for osteoporosis management, while IV fluids are used for hydration. Teriparatide, being a recombinant human parathyroid hormone analog, is specifically indicated for treating osteoporosis and increasing bone formation, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

Answer: D",2388
736,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient avoids places due to her urge incontinence, indicating a fear of not being able to escape similar situations. This aligns with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, specifically a specific phobia or social anxiety disorder. The symptoms lasting 3 months and continuing despite treatment suggest a chronic condition. Social phobia can often co-occur with other anxiety disorders, supporting option D.

Answer: D",1947
737,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea, palpitations, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, which suggests atrial fibrillation (AFib). Digoxin is known to slow the heart rate in AFib by increasing vagal tone and reducing the conduction through the AV node. The fact that the patient's heart rate dropped from 125/min to 85/min after receiving digoxin indicates its effect on slowing the heart rate. 

Answer: C",1633
738,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The case-fatality rate (CFR) is calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases, expressed as a percentage. Here, the number of cases is 25% of 500 individuals, which equals 125 individuals. The number of deaths is 5. Therefore, the CFR is \( \frac{5}{125} \times 100 = 4\% \).

Answer: A",1518
739,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's initial presentation of alertness with anterograde amnesia followed by a decline in level of consciousness and a fixed, dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex suggests a posterior fossa hemorrhage or mass effect. The blood pressure elevation and the presence of a fixed and dilated pupil indicate increased intracranial pressure. The noncontrast CT of the head would likely show evidence of a mass lesion or hemorrhage. Among the options, an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the most likely cause of these findings, as it can present with a mass effect leading to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deficits. A dural arteriovenous fistula typically presents with chronic symptoms and does not usually cause acute changes in consciousness or fixed dilated pupils. A Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm is associated with hypertension and typically presents with focal neurological deficits rather than generalized changes in consciousness. Tearing of the middle meningeal artery would more likely present with localized symptoms rather than the widespread neurological changes observed.

Answer: D",2641
740,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has type 1 diabetes and experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia (sweating, hand tremors, weakness) during the night, but his morning blood glucose is high. This suggests nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by rebound hyperglycemia. Adding pramlintide would not address the hypoglycemia. Increasing the daily insulin dose could worsen nocturnal hypoglycemia. Reducing the daily insulin dose might help prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, the best initial approach is often reassurance and education about recognizing and managing hypoglycemia.

Answer: A",1686
741,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Chlorine dioxide, isopropyl alcohol, and povidone-iodine all oxidize and denature proteins, making them effective disinfectants. However, benzalkonium chloride does not fit this description as it is a quaternary ammonium compound and does not oxidize proteins. Therefore, the researcher most likely used chlorine dioxide, given its ability to oxidize and denature proteins effectively.

Answer: A",2332
742,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is not associated with any of the given options. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are not typically associated with mitral stenosis. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect, not a complication of maternal heart disease. Therefore, the infant is not at high risk for these conditions.

Answer: D",1910
743,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include back pain, lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense, along with difficulty controlling bowel movements and a rectal examination revealing a hard nodular mass. These findings suggest a lesion affecting the spinal cord or its surrounding structures. 

- Syringomyelia typically causes pain, temperature, and touch deficits in a segmental distribution without significant motor weakness or bowel/bladder issues.
- Herniated disc usually presents with radicular pain and localized weakness rather than diffuse sensory deficits and bowel/bladder involvement.
- Spinal hematoma can cause back pain and neurological deficits but does not typically present with a palpable mass in the rectum.

Given the presence of a palpable mass and neurological deficits, spinal metastasis from a primary tumor such as multiple myeloma is the most likely cause.

Answer: B",1719
744,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty staying awake during activities, and episodes of sudden generalized weakness. These symptoms are consistent with narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone). Modafinil is commonly used to treat narcolepsy and other sleep disorders associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Clomipramine is an antidepressant and not typically used for narcolepsy. Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant used for ADHD and narcolepsy but is not the first-line treatment for narcolepsy. Sleep deprivation is not a therapeutic intervention but rather a potential cause of worsening sleepiness.

Answer: C",2148
745,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient experiences lightheadedness and hypotension (110/55 mm Hg) after hemodialysis, indicating a potential volume depletion. Cooling the dialysate or eating heavier meals would not directly address the volume depletion. Increasing ultrafiltration could worsen the hypotension. Steroid administration is not indicated for this condition. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to avoid increasing ultrafiltration.

Answer: C",2047
746,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, diaphoresis, and increased muscle tone with clonus, suggesting a sympathomimetic or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The recent start of an amino acid supplement, particularly tryptophan, can cause a syndrome similar to serotonin syndrome if it interacts with her citalopram. Tryptophan can increase serotonin levels, leading to these symptoms. The other options are less likely given the context and symptoms.

Answer: B",2984
747,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath, along with bilateral crackles on lung examination. These findings are consistent with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a condition where smooth muscle-like cells grow in the lungs and lymphatic vessels. The elevated serum potassium (5.8 mEq/L) suggests hyperkalemia, which can be associated with LAM due to impaired renal potassium excretion. The urine shows protein and blood, indicating possible kidney involvement. 

Given the context of LAM, the most appropriate treatment is targeted at managing the underlying condition. Sirolimus is the FDA-approved drug for LAM, but it is not listed as an option. The other options involve immunosuppressive therapy, which is not the primary treatment for LAM. Plasmapheresis is used for certain autoimmune conditions but not for LAM. 

Eliminating incorrect options:
- A: Methylprednisolone alone does not address the underlying condition.
- C: Adding plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide is not indicated for LAM.
- D: Plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide are not indicated for LAM.

Answer: B",1779
748,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency, along with high blood glucose and low potassium levels. These symptoms suggest a pheochromocytoma, given the headache, and the abdominal CT scan showing a mass in the left adrenal gland. Pheochromocytomas produce catecholamines, which act via the adrenergic receptors, primarily through the cAMP pathway.

Answer: B",1550
749,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms, including a severe headache, jaw pain worse with chewing, and scalp tenderness, do not align with Kawasaki disease, which primarily affects young children and presents with specific skin and mucous membrane findings. The headache and jaw pain are more suggestive of a vascular issue such as a cerebral aneurysm or temporal arteritis, especially given the high blood pressure. A CT head can help rule out intracranial hemorrhage or other structural causes. Ibuprofen and lumbar puncture are less appropriate without further diagnostic evidence. Steroids are typically used for inflammatory conditions like temporal arteritis but would be too aggressive without confirming the diagnosis.

Answer: A",2155
750,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand, indicating peripheral neuropathy. Among the chemotherapy agents listed, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib, vincristine is known to cause neurotoxicity through its mechanism of action, which involves disrupting microtubule formation.

Answer: B",2097
751,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia, low-set ears, and retrognathia. These symptoms suggest a genetic syndrome rather than a specific anatomical defect like duodenal atresia or posterior urethral valves. Rocker bottom feet are associated with syndromes like congenital vertical talus but do not typically cause pulmonary hypoplasia. Posterior urethral valves can cause respiratory issues but are more commonly associated with urinary tract symptoms. Hepatosplenomegaly is not directly related to the presented symptoms.

Answer: B",1463
752,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has severe neutropenia (leukocyte count dropped from 800 to 2,000/mm³ with 5% monocytes to 2,000/mm³ with 2% monocytes) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count increased from 50,000 to 56,000/mm³). Aldesleukin (option A) is a form of IL-2 and would not cause neutropenia. Interferon beta (option B) can cause bone marrow suppression but typically affects both neutrophils and platelets more equally. Filgrastim (option C) is used to increase neutrophil counts and would not cause neutropenia. Romiplostim (option D) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist and would not cause neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

Answer: A",1885
753,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a premature neonate with signs of respiratory distress, including intercostal retractions and nasal flaring. The chest x-ray shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities, which are consistent with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to surfactant deficiency. This condition is common in preterm infants who lack sufficient surfactant production. Bilateral pleural effusions, corkscrew-shaped organisms, and meconium-stained fluid are not typically associated with RDS. Therefore, the most likely finding is hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy, which is characteristic of RDS.

Answer: C",1563
754,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with episodes of severe right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with mild scleral icterus and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). These findings are consistent with choledocholithiasis, given the presence of multiple gallstones and an enlarged common bile duct on ultrasound. Other conditions like acute hepatitis A, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis would typically present differently, with more specific symptoms or findings. 

Answer: B",2754
755,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased air movement on the right side, which are concerning for a pulmonary embolism (PE). Given her recent travel and the presence of risk factors such as immobilization during the trip, a V/Q scan would be the best initial non-invasive test to evaluate for PE. An ECG is more useful for detecting arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, a chest radiograph can show structural abnormalities but not functional perfusion issues, and a CT pulmonary angiogram is invasive and typically reserved for confirmed cases or when other tests are inconclusive.

Answer: C",2666
756,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's mass was found to be Hodgkin's cells, indicating Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chemotherapy was initiated, and after the first cycle, the patient noticed red urine with blood. Bleomycin is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis and skin reactions but not hematuria. Cyclophosphamide can cause hemorrhagic cystitis leading to hematuria. Doxorubicin can cause cardiac toxicity and gastrointestinal side effects but not hematuria. Etoposide can cause pulmonary toxicity but not hematuria. Therefore, the most likely cause of the hematuria is cyclophosphamide.

Answer: B",1959
757,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a high fever, generalized rash, myalgia, and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). These symptoms are consistent with Kawasaki disease, especially given the widespread erythematous rash and skin peeling on the palms and soles. A recent hiking trip could potentially expose her to environmental factors triggering the condition, but there is no specific indication of exposure to infectious agents like those seen in meningococcemia or drug use. Menstruation does not typically present with these symptoms. Therefore, the most likely trigger is a recent environmental exposure.

Answer: A",2585
758,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, low hemoglobin, and splenomegaly, suggest a hematologic disorder such as amyloidosis. The presence of a high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur and head bobbing are consistent with a pericardial or valvular issue, often seen in amyloidosis. The neoplastic growth in the descending colon further supports a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, where the neoplasm produces the amyloid protein. Other options like Treponema pallidum, collagen vascular disease, or Group D streptococci do not align with the comprehensive presentation of systemic involvement and hematologic findings.

Answer: B",2466
759,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient developed difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, and hypotension after taking a 'blood improving' medication. These symptoms suggest an allergic reaction or severe side effect. Interleukin 3 (IL-3) can cause bone marrow hyperplasia and increase the risk of thrombocytosis, but it is less commonly associated with these specific symptoms. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombopoietin (THPO) are primarily involved in platelet production and do not typically cause these symptoms. Sargramostim, also known as GM-CSF, is used to stimulate white blood cell production and can cause bone pain and fever, but not the severe hypotension and respiratory issues seen here. Therefore, the most likely medication causing these symptoms is Interleukin 3.

Answer: A",2150
760,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increasing confusion, unusual behavior, and a 6-day history of not eating or drinking. These symptoms are more consistent with anorexia nervosa leading to starvation and metabolic derangements rather than a primary neurological or systemic condition. The disorganized speech and psychomotor agitation are also suggestive of a metabolic disturbance. Checking serum electrolytes is crucial to identify any imbalances caused by starvation.

Answer: B",2376
761,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, generalized fatigue, chills, right-side abdominal pain, and tenderness, along with decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. These symptoms suggest a possible infection or inflammation. The laboratory findings show slightly elevated white blood cells and liver enzymes, but no significant elevation in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase, which makes conditions like hepatitis less likely. The right upper quadrant ultrasound would help identify any focal liver lesions or abscesses. Given the clinical presentation and imaging needs, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not indicated without specific biliary or pancreatic pathology, and there's no indication for percutaneous drainage or discontinuing the oral contraceptive. An hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan could be considered if there's suspicion of biliary obstruction, but it’s not the first step.

Answer: B",3090
762,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with an HbA1C of 8.5% and serum glucose of 240 mg/dL, indicating poor glycemic control. He also has peripheral neuropathy with symptoms of numbness in both hands and feet. Metformin alone is typically insufficient for achieving target HbA1C levels in patients who do not achieve adequate glycemic control despite lifestyle modifications. Adding a basal-bolus insulin regimen would provide better glucose control and address the high glucose levels. Sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones are less effective as monotherapy compared to insulin in this scenario.

Answer: A",1875
763,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation, which are indicative of Wernicke encephalopathy. This condition is typically caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The metabolic reaction involving thiamine is the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, which is part of the citric acid cycle. The other options do not involve thiamine and are unrelated to the patient's symptoms.

Answer: A",1815
764,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is in active labor and has significant hypotension and tachycardia, indicating possible hemorrhagic shock. Given the hospital's inability to manage high-risk pregnancies, transferring the patient to a more capable center is necessary. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires providing necessary medical treatment, which includes stabilizing the patient before transfer if feasible. However, the patient insists on immediate transfer, and the risks of delaying transfer are high due to the potential for worsening hemorrhagic shock.

Answer: C",1901
765,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with wheezing and dyspnea, eosinophilia, and positive skin tests for allergens, indicating allergic asthma. Beta-2 antagonists and muscarinic antagonists are used to relax smooth muscles and reduce airway constriction. However, histone deacetylase inhibitors and anticoagulants are not directly related to asthma management. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment would be a muscarinic antagonist to help relax the airways.

Answer: C",965
766,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient is a 16-year-old female with no menstrual period, normal external genitalia, and pubic hair. Ultrasound shows an absent uterus, and serum testosterone levels are normal. These findings suggest a congenital anomaly affecting female reproductive development rather than hormonal issues. A pituitary tumor would likely cause elevated hormone levels or other endocrine disturbances, which are not present here. Absence of the second X chromosome would typically present with underdeveloped external genitalia and other Turner syndrome features, not normal pubic hair. Failure of paramesonephric duct development would result in an absent vagina or cervix, not just an absent uterus. Androgen receptor mutations would lead to masculinization, which is not observed here. Therefore, the most likely cause is absence of the second X chromosome leading to Müllerian duct agenesis.

Answer: B",1319
767,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 61-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, fatigue, and increased abdominal girth. She has a small uterus and a right adnexal mass on bimanual examination. These findings suggest a possible ovarian mass, which could be associated with elevated serum CA-125 levels. There is no indication of pregnancy (no beta-hCG elevation), coagulation disorder (no prolonged prothrombin time), or cervical dysplasia (as indicated by the previous negative Pap smear). 

Answer: A",1977
768,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has urinary tract obstruction, indicated by the absence of urine output from the suprapubic catheter and the presence of pus. A renal biopsy is not relevant for evaluating urinary tract obstruction. An abdominal-pelvic CT scan could provide detailed imaging but is not the best initial method. Blood analysis alone cannot diagnose urinary tract obstruction. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, effective method to visualize the urinary tract and identify obstructions.

Answer: B",3240
769,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of a high-frequency bilateral hand tremor that improves over the course of the day are consistent with essential tremor rather than Parkinson's disease. Essential tremor typically worsens with activity and improves at rest, while Parkinson's tremor is often more prominent at rest and less responsive to activity. Given the patient's family history of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor is a plausible diagnosis. 

- Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and panic disorders, not specifically for tremor.
- Primidone is used for seizures and essential tremor but is not the first-line treatment.
- Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for essential tremor but is not the first choice.
- Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic used for essential tremor and is often the first-line treatment.

Answer: C",2308
770,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The pediatrician is describing a series of cases where patients developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. This suggests a case series rather than a randomized controlled trial or hypothesis testing. Case series are observational studies that describe a group of patients with a particular condition. They do not allow for hypothesis testing or intervention studies. The odds ratio is typically used in case-control studies, not case series. Self-controls are not applicable here as it's not a longitudinal study comparing the same individuals under different conditions.

Answer: B",1970
771,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presented with severe internal bleeding and required emergency surgery. Post-surgery, he showed signs of target cells (likely indicating hemolysis), thrombocytosis (increased platelets), and leukocytosis (increased white blood cells). These findings suggest a condition like hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which can be caused by certain medications like quinine or clonidine. The prophylactic regimen would aim to prevent further complications. Among the options, only a 50S ribosome inhibitor (chloramphenicol or related drugs) is known to cause such hematological abnormalities as a side effect. Other options do not typically cause these specific symptoms.

Answer: B",1902
772,Treatment,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with intense itching and excoriations around the anus, which is consistent with scabies. The scotch tape test was positive, confirming the diagnosis. Amphotericin B is used for fungal and leishmaniasis infections, making it an incorrect choice. Praziquantel is used for treating parasitic worms like schistosomiasis and tapeworms, not scabies. Pyrantel pamoate is used for treating nematode infections in animals, not humans. Ivermectin is effective against scabies and other parasitic infections, making it a suitable alternative to albendazole.

Answer: B",1504
773,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with high blood pressure, a webbed neck, and a history of amenorrhea and infertility. The webbed neck suggests a genetic disorder such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH can lead to hypertension due to hormonal imbalances, including low serum aldosterone and high serum testosterone, which aligns with the adrenal gland involvement. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation: central fusion of the kidneys is not related to blood pressure, genetic predisposition to essential hypertension does not explain the specific hormonal imbalance, and oral contraceptives are not typically associated with such symptoms.

Answer: C",1414
774,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Sickle cell disease can cause various renal complications due to microvascular occlusion and chronic hemolysis. Proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA) is not a common complication of sickle cell disease. Instead, sickle cell disease can impair the kidney's ability to concentrate urine (impaired urine concentrating ability) and dilute urine (impaired urine diluting ability). However, the specific impairment in concentrating ability is more commonly associated with sickle cell nephropathy.

Answer: D",1961
775,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The gunshot wound is at the level of L3, which is in the lumbar region. The inferior vena cava is located at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra, making it the closest major vascular structure to this level. The internal iliac vein is located in the pelvic region, the renal artery is located in the renal hilum, and the portal vein is associated with the liver. Given the location of the wound, the bullet is most likely to have injured the inferior vena cava.

Answer: A",1272
776,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The number needed to treat (NNT) is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). Here, the ARR is the difference in cure rates between the two groups. The cure rate for the study treatment group is 190/250 = 0.76, and for the control group, it is 165/250 = 0.66. Thus, the ARR is 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.10. The NNT is then 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.10 = 10. However, none of the provided options directly match this calculation. Instead, we need to find an option that aligns with the given data points. Option C (190/250) correctly reflects the proportion of participants cured in the study treatment group, which is relevant to the NNT calculation.

Answer: C",1422
777,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include chronic, widespread pain and sleeping issues, which are common in fibromyalgia. The presence of point tenderness in multiple areas (occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees) further supports this diagnosis. Fibromyalgia is often treated with low-dose prednisolone to reduce inflammation and pain. Paroxetine, which the patient took previously for anxiety, is also an option but is not typically the first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. Allopurinol is used for conditions related to uric acid levels, such as gout, and is not indicated here.

Answer: A",2182
778,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The ACGME sets specific limits on resident work hours to ensure patient safety and resident well-being. According to these guidelines, residents are limited to 80 hours of work per week, including both residency and non-residency activities. The resident in question works 60 hours per week in his residency and 10 additional hours on Saturdays, totaling 70 hours per week. This is within the allowed limit. However, the key issue here is that the resident is seeking to work more hours, specifically up to 90 hours per week (60 in residency + 30 external). This exceeds the ACGME limit of 80 hours per week. Therefore, the resident cannot work more than the allowed 80 hours without violating the ACGME standards.

Answer: A",2097
779,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has active bleeding from lacerations, which would lead to a potential decrease in blood volume and subsequent hypovolemic shock. This scenario does not suggest baroreceptor-mediated vasodilation, increased acetylcholine at the sinoatrial node, or increased atrial natriuretic peptide release. Instead, the body would respond to the hypovolemia by increasing sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node to maintain blood pressure.

Answer: D",1945
780,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 14-year-old teenager with symptoms of frequent headaches, excessive fatigue, weight gain, and nonpitting edema. His standing blood pressure drop suggests orthostatic hypotension, and fundoscopic exam shows papilledema with bitemporal hemianopsia, indicating increased intracranial pressure. Laboratory findings show hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate). These findings are consistent with central diabetes insipidus, which can be caused by a pituitary adenoma pressing on the hypothalamus and causing ADH deficiency.

- Option A (Chemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation): This is not applicable for a hormonal disorder.
- Option B (Chemotherapy and radiation): Not relevant for this hormonal condition.
- Option C (Surgical resection): While a pituitary adenoma might require surgical removal, this is not the primary treatment for central diabetes insipidus.
- Option D (Hormone replacement therapy): This is not appropriate for treating central diabetes insipidus.

Answer: D",3383
781,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: HIF-1α is a protein that is stabilized under hypoxic conditions due to inhibition of VHL-mediated hydroxylation. In normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is targeted for degradation. Therefore, in RCC cells under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α levels should be lower compared to normoxic control cells. Northern blots detect RNA, not proteins, so options A and C are incorrect. Southern blots are used for DNA analysis, not protein detection, making option C incorrect. Only Western blots detect proteins, and given the context, HIF-1α levels would be lower in normoxic RCC cells compared to normoxic control cells.

Answer: D",1464
782,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, hypertension, and edema. These symptoms are indicative of preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria in pregnancy. Elevated transaminases can indicate liver dysfunction, which might be seen in severe preeclampsia, but it is not the most common finding. Leukocytosis could suggest an underlying infection, but there is no evidence of infection in this case. Hyponatremia can occur in preeclampsia but is less common compared to proteinuria. Proteinuria, being a hallmark of preeclampsia, is the most common finding.

Answer: D",2521
783,Mechanism,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The child presents with chronic fatigue, a rotund abdomen with a positive fluid wave, and lower extremity edema. These symptoms suggest a condition related to malnutrition or a metabolic disorder. Given the context of recent arrival and refugee status, the most likely cause is a nutritional deficiency. Among the options, riboflavin deficiency can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and edema due to its role in energy metabolism and cellular respiration. Other options like total caloric intake, relative protein, carbohydrate, or fat intake deficiencies would present different sets of symptoms not matching the given clinical picture.

Answer: A",2170
784,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is at 10 weeks gestation and is experiencing early pregnancy symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Given her age (42 years), there is an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is typically performed between 10-12 weeks and can provide results earlier than amniocentesis, which is usually done later in pregnancy. However, CVS carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage compared to amniocentesis. 

Cell-free DNA testing is a non-invasive test that can be performed earlier in pregnancy and has a lower risk of complications. Given the patient's age and the availability of non-invasive testing, this would be the preferred option.

Answer: B",2462
785,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, and recurrent vomiting. These suggest a systemic illness like HIV infection. The presence of multiple nonblanching maculae, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are consistent with Kaposi sarcoma, which is associated with HIV. The high proliferation index (>99%) indicates rapid cell division, typical of lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma. Given the context of the other options, B lymphocytes are the most likely cells, as they are involved in the immune response and can proliferate rapidly in conditions like HIV infection.

Answer: C",1570
786,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a hot, swollen, erythematous left knee with severe pain, indicating a possible hemostatic defect. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged at 53 seconds, while the prothrombin time (PT) is normal at 11 seconds. This suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which involves factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Bradykinin formation is decreased, which is characteristic of a deficiency in factor XII, as it is involved in the activation of bradykinin. 

Answer: D",1927
787,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's cystoscopy findings include pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall with a biopsy showing stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis, suggesting a vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to nyctalopia (night blindness), which aligns with option C. Carpopedal spasm (option A) is associated with hypocalcemia, photodermatitis (option B) is related to porphyria or certain medications, and intracranial hypertension (option D) is not directly linked to vitamin A deficiency. Therefore, the most likely feature is night blindness.

Answer: C",1745
788,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Betamethasone is a corticosteroid used to accelerate fetal lung maturity in cases of preterm labor. It does not directly stimulate goblet cells, bronchial epithelial cells, or vascular smooth muscle cells. Type II pneumocytes are involved in surfactant production, which is the primary effect of betamethasone in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Answer: C",2316
789,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with syncope, palpitations, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves. This pattern is characteristic of long QT syndrome, where the QT interval is prolonged, leading to an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia. The patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus does not directly suggest hypomagnesemia, brugada syndrome, or hyperkalemia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is a prolonged QT interval.

Answer: C",2218
790,Treatment,False,D,B,"Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the required dose to achieve the target plasma concentration of 2 mg/L. The formula for calculating the dose is:

\[ \text{Dose} = \text{Target Plasma Concentration} \times \text{Volume of Distribution} \]

The volume of distribution can be estimated using the clearance and the plasma concentration:

\[ \text{Volume of Distribution} = \frac{\text{Clearance} \times \text{Weight}}{\text{Target Plasma Concentration}} \]

Given:
- Clearance = 15.0 L/h
- Target Plasma Concentration = 2 mg/L
- Weight = 75 kg (since the oral bioavailability is 75%, the weight used for calculation is the same)

\[ \text{Volume of Distribution} = \frac{15.0 \times 75}{2} = 562.5 \, \text{L} \]

However, this seems unusually high, so we use the simplified approach assuming a standard volume of distribution for amoxicillin, typically around 0.5-1 L/kg. For simplicity, let's use 0.75 L/kg:

\[ \text{Volume of Distribution} = 0.75 \times 75 = 56.25 \, \text{L} \]

Now, calculate the dose:

\[ \text{Dose} = 2 \times 56.25 = 112.5 \, \text{mg} \]

Since the drug is administered twice daily, the dose per administration is:

\[ \text{Dose per Administration} = \frac{112.5}{2} = 56.25 \, \text{mg} \]

However, none of the options match this exact value. Given the closest option, we consider the typical dosing for amoxicillin, which is often around 500 mg every 8 hours. Thus, the closest reasonable answer is:

Answer: D",1546
791,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The boy's symptoms include blood in the urine, difficulty in passing urine, lower abdominal pain, and a burning sensation. These symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urinalysis shows RBCs, WBCs, and casts, which are indicative of a UTI. The pediatrician suspects a double-stranded DNA virus, which is most likely adenovirus, known to cause conjunctivitis and respiratory infections but can also cause a UTI. Gastroenteritis (option A) is unrelated to the urinary symptoms. Painful dermatomal vesicles (option B) are characteristic of herpes zoster, not adenovirus. Lymphadenopathy (option C) can occur with adenovirus but is not specifically associated with UTIs. A vesicular rash (option D) is more indicative of herpes zoster rather than adenovirus.

Answer: A",2031
792,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include difficulty initiating sleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, daytime sleepiness, and inability to concentrate. These symptoms suggest a primary issue with sleep maintenance and quality rather than anxiety or ADHD, which would be more indicative of amphetamine use. Modafinil is primarily used for promoting wakefulness and is not indicated for treating insomnia. Chlordiazepoxide, triazolam, and diazepam are benzodiazepines that can improve sleep initiation and maintenance, making them more suitable for this patient's needs.

Answer: A",2005
793,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The EEG findings of a 3-Hz spike and wave pattern suggest a diagnosis of absence seizures, consistent with the child’s symptoms of spacing out. The first-line treatment for absence seizures is typically valproic acid or ethosuximide. Amphetamine, while used for ADHD, is not indicated for absence seizures. Potential side effects of ethosuximide include gastrointestinal upset, which aligns with option B. The other options (nystagmus, facial rash, blood in the urine, weight gain, and change in hair color) are not typical side effects of ethosuximide.

Answer: B",2015
794,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath and fatigue, which are common symptoms of heart valve disorders. Given his history of smoking and hypertension, aortic valve stenosis (AoS) is a likely cause of these symptoms, as it can lead to reduced cardiac output and resultant shortness of breath. Mitral valve prolapse and tricuspid valve stenosis are less likely given the absence of specific symptoms like palpitations or right-sided heart failure. The physical examination showing weak peripheral pulses supports AoS, as reduced aortic valve area leads to decreased stroke volume and peripheral hypotension.

Answer: D",1481
795,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells suggest impaired endothelial function. Arginine is a precursor for nitric oxide (NO), and its decreased concentration implies reduced NO production. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator that helps maintain vascular tone and blood flow. Therefore, decreased arginine would lead to decreased NO production, contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C",1399
796,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The scenario describes a plan to intentionally infect a group of people (prisoners) with chlamydia to test a new treatment. This practice raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding the principles of medical ethics. The ethical principle of nonmaleficence requires that researchers do not harm participants. Intentionally infecting individuals with a disease, even if it is to test a potential cure, carries inherent risks and could cause harm. Therefore, the physician should refuse based on the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

Answer: C",1860
797,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include progressive shortness of breath, scattered expiratory wheezing, eosinophilia, and a sputum culture showing septate hyphae branching at 45 degrees, which suggests a fungal infection like aspergillosis. Interferon alpha (IFN-α) is associated with antifungal activity and is part of the type-I interferon family. Elevated eosinophils and immunoglobulin E (IgE) suggest an allergic or parasitic reaction, but the presence of septate hyphae points towards a fungal etiology. IL-28 and TGF-β are not directly related to the antifungal response or the patient's symptoms. IL-4 can be involved in allergic reactions but does not specifically correlate with the fungal infection indicated by the sputum findings.

Answer: C",1826
798,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae, indicating polyhydramnios. The ultrasound shows 2.5 L of amniotic fluid and an AFI of 34, both indicative of polyhydramnios. Duodenal atresia is known to cause polyhydramnios due to the inability of the fetus to absorb swallowed amniotic fluid. Renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and posterior urethral valve do not typically cause polyhydramnios.

Answer: C",1547
799,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe chest pain and hemodynamic instability, indicating possible acute coronary syndrome with potential cardiogenic shock. The primary goal is to improve hemodynamic status quickly. 

- **Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor**: Activation would decrease sympathetic outflow, potentially worsening hypotension.
- **Beta-1 adrenergic receptor**: Metoprolol already blocks beta-1 receptors, so stimulating them would not be beneficial.
- **Beta-2 adrenergic receptor**: While beta-2 agonists can improve cardiac output, they are not typically first-line for acute coronary syndrome.
- **D2 receptor**: Dopamine D2 receptor activation would increase sympathetic outflow, potentially worsening the patient’s condition.

Answer: B",2102
800,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool, which suggest gastrointestinal bleeding and iron overload. Given the context that the child was seen playing with his mother’s vitamin supplements, the most likely cause is iron poisoning from the vitamin supplements. Deferoxamine is used to treat acute iron poisoning, making it the appropriate treatment. Dimercaprol and protamine are not indicated for iron poisoning, and succimer is typically used for heavy metal poisoning, not iron.

Answer: B",1779
801,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine increases the risk of neural tube defects, which can manifest as meningocele. Carbamazepine is known to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy. The other options are less directly related to the medication's known teratogenic effects. Renal dysplasia is more associated with multicystic dysplastic kidney, sensorineural hearing loss is not typically linked to carbamazepine, and vaginal clear cell carcinoma is rare and not a common complication of carbamazepine use.

Answer: B",1697
802,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: 
- The first child can lift his head and chest in the prone position and track an object with his eyes to the midline. This indicates an age of approximately 1 month, as these are typical milestones for that age group.
- The second child can roll from supine to prone and transfer her rattle from hand to hand but cannot yet say any words. Rolling is typically achieved around 4 months, and transferring objects between hands is also around this age, while speaking words usually starts around 12 months.
- The third child can take independent steps and recognize the names of several objects but cannot follow directions like ""grab the ball."" Taking independent steps is a milestone for around 9 months, and recognizing object names is closer to 12 months, but the inability to follow directions suggests a younger age of around 9 months.

Answer: A",1957
803,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with transient symptoms of slurred speech and arm weakness, which are classic signs of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given her history of atrial fibrillation, a risk factor for stroke, and the need to rule out an underlying vascular cause, a CT angiogram would be the best next step to visualize the blood vessels and check for any potential arterial blockages. An echocardiogram is not indicated for ruling out arterial causes of TIA. Heparin is used for anticoagulation but is not the first step in diagnosis. An MRI is less urgent than a CT angiogram for immediate evaluation.
Answer: A",2287
804,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include progressive weakness, difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing, along with muscle weakness and diminished reflexes. These symptoms are consistent with botulism, a condition caused by botulinum toxin, which can lead to respiratory failure and paralysis. Botulinum toxin is neutralized by antitoxin, making it the most appropriate treatment. Neostigmine is used to reverse neuromuscular blockade, plasmapheresis is used to remove circulating toxin, and riluzole is used for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, none of which are indicated here.

Answer: A",1833
805,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include difficulty starting urination and a sensation of fullness in the pelvis, with a protrusion from the anterior vaginal wall on coughing. These symptoms are consistent with a cystocele, where the bladder bulges into the vagina, leading to difficulty initiating urination and a feeling of pelvic fullness. Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma would present with more severe symptoms and masses, not specifically related to urination issues. Rectocele involves the rectum and would not typically cause urinary symptoms. Uterine leiomyomata usually cause heavy menstrual bleeding and do not directly affect urination.
Answer: B",1635
806,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with ongoing diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. Colonoscopy shows patchy erythema and ulceration throughout the colon, and biopsy indicates colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. These findings are consistent with Crohn's disease, which can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and often presents with patchy inflammation and ulceration. While acute infective colitis and pseudomembranous colitis can cause colitis, they typically present with more defined areas of involvement and specific pathogens. Irritable bowel syndrome does not typically present with colonic ulceration or significant inflammation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn's disease.

Answer: A",2773
807,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has significant hypotension, cold extremities, and a low ScvO2 despite aggressive resuscitation and no active blood loss. These findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade, where the heart is compressed by pericardial fluid, leading to decreased venous return and cardiac output. The other options do not fit the clinical picture: cervical spinal cord transection would cause quadriplegia, pulmonary embolism would not explain the low ScvO2, and undiagnosed pneumonia would not account for the hypotension and cold extremities.

Answer: A",3017
808,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with impaired memory, poor orientation in space, and difficulty with newly introduced information, consistent with early-stage dementia. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 18 suggests mild cognitive impairment. Given the family history of dementia, Alzheimer's disease is a likely diagnosis. 

- **Imipramine**:主要用于治疗抑郁症，不是用于认知障碍或阿尔茨海默病的首选药物。
- **Lithium**: 主要用于治疗双相情感障碍，不适用于阿尔茨海默病。
- **Donepezil**: 常用于治疗轻至中度阿尔茨海默病的认知症状。
- **Sulpiride**: 主要用于治疗精神分裂症和重度抑郁，不是阿尔茨海默病的首选药物。

Answer: C",2711
809,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset severe pain, redness, swelling, and warmth in the right knee, which are classic signs of septic arthritis. The elevated CRP and procalcitonin levels further support a bacterial infection. Synovial fluid analysis typically shows a high white blood cell count (>50,000/mm³) with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (>75%) in septic arthritis. The viscosity is usually high due to the inflammatory exudate.

Answer: B",2188
810,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has spherocytes on peripheral blood smear, which suggests a hereditary membrane defect of red blood cells. The Coombs test is negative, ruling out immune-mediated hemolysis. Spherocytes are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, an inherited membrane abnormality of red cells. The patient also has scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly, consistent with this condition. The liver function tests are not indicated here as the primary issue is with the red blood cells, not the liver.

Answer: B",2128
811,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with irritability, aggression, impulsivity, and jerky limb movements, which are suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder such as Huntington's disease. The family history of a father with dementia in his mid-40s further supports this diagnosis. MRI changes in Huntington's disease typically show degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. 

Answer: C",1620
812,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with hemoptysis, nonproductive cough, fatigue, and significant weight loss over 8 months. These symptoms are more consistent with lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, given the rapid progression and weight loss. The chest x-ray shows a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders, which is a common presentation for adenocarcinoma. Carcinoid tumors typically present with paraneoplastic syndromes and are less likely to cause such rapid weight loss and hemoptysis. Sarcoidosis usually presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates, not a solitary nodule. Squamous cell carcinoma can present similarly but is less common than adenocarcinoma in the absence of smoking.

Answer: D",1983
813,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient has well-controlled hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril but still has elevated blood pressure. The presence of a systolic murmur and split S2 suggests valvular heart disease rather than primary hyperaldosteronism or hypothyroidism, which do not typically present with murmurs. Stiffening of the aorta is less likely to cause a systolic murmur. Aortic stenosis would present with a harsh, crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, which fits the description here.
Answer: D",2158
814,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is an 11-month-old boy with only one palpable testicle (right) and a second testicle in the inguinal canal. This presentation is consistent with undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). Chorionic gonadotropin therapy is not typically used for cryptorchidism. Exploratory laparoscopy is too invasive for this condition. Orchiectomy is indicated for testicular torsion or other severe conditions, which are not present here. Orchiopexy is the standard treatment for cryptorchidism to ensure proper descent and reduce the risk of infertility and testicular cancer.

Answer: D",1685
815,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with nausea, weakness, and right costovertebral angle tenderness, suggesting possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The elevated C-reactive protein (16.4 mg/L) indicates inflammation, supporting this diagnosis. Urinalysis is the most appropriate initial test to confirm the presence of UTI by examining urine for signs of infection such as leukocytes, nitrites, and bacteria. Cervical swabs and blood cultures are not indicated based on the clinical presentation, and a CT scan is unnecessary without specific imaging indications.

Answer: A",1941
816,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used to treat osteoporosis. It mimics the beneficial effects of estrogen on bone density but can increase the risk of certain cancers, particularly breast cancer. The patient's family history of breast cancer (mother died at 48) increases her risk. There is no information suggesting an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, cellulitis, or hypercholesterolemia specifically related to raloxifene use.

Answer: C",1621
817,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Capitation involves physicians receiving a fixed payment for each patient enrolled over a specific period, regardless of the services provided. This does not match fee-for-service, which pays based on each service rendered. Fee-for-service can indeed incentivize increased utilization as physicians earn more with more services. Capitation, however, poses higher financial risk to physicians if patient needs exceed the fixed payment. 

Answer: C",1704
818,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss, multiple DVTs, and a pulmonary embolism. Given her history of blood clots and recurrent fetal loss, anticoagulation is necessary to prevent further clotting events. Aspirin is often used in low doses for anticoagulation in pregnancy, and heparin is a safer alternative than warfarin for use during pregnancy. Rivaroxaban is not typically recommended in pregnancy due to limited data and potential risks to the fetus. Therefore, aspirin and heparin would be the most appropriate management.

Answer: A",2125
819,Diagnosis,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has not attained menarche, normal breast development, scant axillary hair, and a blind vaginal pouch without visible uterus or ovaries on ultrasound. This presentation is consistent with a condition where there is a lack of external female genitalia and internal female reproductive structures, which points towards a disorder of sex development (DSD). Among the options, sex chromosome monosomy (Turner syndrome) typically presents with short stature, webbed neck, and other features not seen here. 5-α reductase deficiency leads to male pseudohermaphroditism with enlarged clitoris and female external genitalia, which does not fit. Androgen insensitivity can present with normal breast development and external female genitalia, but typically does not result in a blind vaginal pouch. Sex chromosome mosaicism can present variably but often includes features not seen here, such as ambiguous genitalia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is sex chromosome monosomy.

Answer: B",1503
820,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, along with a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM on serum protein electrophoresis. These findings are consistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, which is characterized by high levels of IgM and involves lymphoplasmacytoid cells and plasma cells. While multiple myeloma can present with similar symptoms, the specific finding of a sharp, narrow IgM spike is more characteristic of Waldenström macroglobulinemia. IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) typically does not cause such severe symptoms, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would not be expected to have such a specific IgM spike.

Answer: C",2052
821,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include impaired memory, word-finding difficulties, and loss of taste and smell, which are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer's disease. However, the presence of generalized cortical atrophy and specific inclusions (PrPSc) in the brain strongly suggests a prion disease like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The inclusions are indicative of the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc).

Answer: D",1636
822,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's skin appears yellow/orange, indicating jaundice. This suggests elevated bilirubin levels, specifically the direct bilirubin level of 7.8 mg/dL, which is higher than the total bilirubin of 11.3 mg/dL, indicating hepatocellular dysfunction. This condition is often associated with decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity, leading to poor conjugation of bilirubin and its accumulation in the blood.

Answer: B",2999
823,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: DVT prophylaxis typically involves anticoagulants like heparin, which works by inhibiting the activation of factor XII. This leads to a prolonged PTT without affecting PT, as PT measures the extrinsic pathway involving factors VII and X, which are not directly inhibited by heparin. Therefore, the most directly affected factor by DVT prophylaxis is factor XII.

Answer: D",1700
824,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist used to treat HIV infection by blocking the CCR5 co-receptor on T-cells. This prevents the virus from entering the cells by targeting the viral envelope protein gp120, which binds to the CCR5 receptor. Therefore, the tropism assay would determine if the virus uses the CCR5 co-receptor. gp160 and p24 are parts of the viral envelope but not receptors. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme involved in the replication process but not a receptor. 

Answer: A",1930
825,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is a 16-year-old female with a breast lump that has recently become tender before her menses. This suggests a benign condition such as a fibroadenoma, which can fluctuate in size due to hormonal changes. The mass is mobile and not fixed, which is consistent with a fibroadenoma. Oral contraceptives can sometimes reduce the size of fibroadenomas due to their hormonal effects, but this is not the most likely outcome given the current presentation. Rapid growth to >5 cm would be more concerning for malignancy, but the current presentation does not suggest this. Axillary lymphadenopathy is not present, ruling out advanced disease.

Answer: C",1644
826,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include severe, worsening headaches, vision loss, and tinnitus, which are concerning for a potential stroke or other neurological issue. Given the severity and new onset of symptoms, a lumbar puncture or MRI would be more appropriate than ibuprofen, which is already ineffective. Tissue plasminogen activator is used for acute ischemic stroke but is not indicated without confirmed ischemic stroke and thrombolysis eligibility. An initial head CT was normal, so further imaging with MRI is warranted to rule out other causes.

Answer: C",1911
827,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and visual field defects, suggesting a pituitary disorder. The visual field defects and galactorrhea are indicative of a mass compressing the optic chiasm and pituitary gland, leading to decreased release of gonadotropins. This fits with the mechanism of inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation and nutritional imbalance are less likely given the absence of uterine pathology and normal BMI. Chromosomal nondisjunction is unlikely without a family history or other chromosomal abnormalities.

Answer: A",1803
828,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with hematemesis, confusion, jaundice, palpable firm liver, splenomegaly, and ascites. These findings suggest portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. The low serum albumin and prolonged prothrombin time indicate liver failure. The presence of ascites and liver enlargement is more consistent with portal hypertension rather than a metabolic disorder or obesity. Substance abuse could contribute to liver damage, but the specific presentation of portal hypertension and ascites is more indicative of hepatic venous outflow obstruction, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Answer: D",1954
829,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, hypotension, confusion, crackles on lung exam, and S4 on cardiac auscultation. These findings suggest a possible pneumonia or sepsis, which could explain the systemic symptoms and confusion. Azithromycin is appropriate for empiric coverage of community-acquired pneumonia. Given the hypotension and confusion, admission to the medical floor is necessary to monitor and manage potential sepsis. Discharge without close monitoring would be inappropriate given the severity of symptoms.

Answer: A",1868
830,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include right hand and leg weakness with a gradual increase in severity, disorientation, and hypertonic reflexes with a positive Babinski reflex. These findings suggest a central nervous system lesion causing upper motor neuron signs. The CT scan is not described, but the clinical presentation aligns more closely with liquefactive necrosis, which is often seen in areas of focal infection or trauma, leading to a liquefied, pus-filled lesion. Gangrenous necrosis typically occurs in extremities due to poor perfusion, caseous necrosis is characteristic of tuberculosis and not commonly seen acutely, and fibrinoid necrosis is more associated with vasculitis. Given the acute onset and neurological presentation, liquefactive necrosis is the most likely pathologic change.

Answer: B",2319
831,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include tender erythematous nodules on the lower legs, which are consistent with erythema nodosum. The recent history of a severe sore throat and fever further supports this diagnosis, as it is commonly associated with streptococcal infections. Throat culture would help confirm a streptococcal infection, but the primary concern here is the skin manifestation. Chest radiograph and bone marrow biopsy are not indicated for this presentation. Colonoscopy is used for gastrointestinal issues, which are not present in this case.

Answer: A",2386
832,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension after rupture of membranes and administration of spinal-epidural anesthesia. These symptoms suggest sepsis, which is consistent with the presence of group B streptococci. The low hemoglobin concentration and undetectable fibrinogen indicate significant bleeding. While apical ballooning and anesthetic agent entry are possible, they do not explain the systemic symptoms and laboratory findings. Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins could lead to sepsis, but it is less likely given the rapid onset and severe presentation. Sepsis from group B streptococci is the most likely underlying cause.

Answer: D",2680
833,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and splenomegaly, along with the inability to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample, suggest a condition like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a reactive process such as reactive lymphocytosis. However, the key to identifying the specific type of cell is the staining pattern. Given the context of travel to South America and the need to identify acid-fast bacteria, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain is specifically designed to identify acid-fast organisms, such as Mycobacterium species, which could be relevant if there were concerns about tuberculosis or leprosy.

Answer: B",2730
834,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient experienced massive hepatic necrosis after general anesthesia. None of the local anesthetics (lidocaine) or the benzodiazepine (midazolam) are used for general anesthesia. Halothane and desflurane are inhalational anesthetics. Halothane is known to cause hepatotoxicity, particularly in cases of pre-existing liver disease or genetic predispositions. Desflurane is not associated with significant hepatotoxicity. Therefore, halothane is the most likely culprit.

Answer: C",1357
835,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has hypothyroidism, progressive fatigue, epigastric pain, and anemia with elevated serum gastrin levels. These findings suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, characterized by excessive gastrin production leading to multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers. The elevated gastrin levels and anemia are consistent with parietal cell destruction, as this leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption and increased gastrin secretion due to lack of inhibition by intrinsic factor. Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia typically causes carcinoid tumors and is not associated with elevated gastrin. Mucosal cell hyperplasia and chief cell destruction are less likely given the context of elevated gastrin and anemia.

Answer: C",1455
836,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Captopril is an ACE inhibitor that can cause hyperkalemia as a side effect. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that also contributes to hyperkalemia. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia do not directly relate to the combination of these drugs. Therefore, the most likely abnormality is hyperkalemia.

Answer: A",1593
837,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with confusion, generalized fatigue, irritability, and a recent history of TIPS placement, indicating possible hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of scleral icterus, jaundice, telangiectasias, palmar erythema, and a flapping tremor further support this diagnosis. The number connection test completion time slower than the age-normalized standard also points towards hepatic encephalopathy. 

- Option A (Reversal of TIPS): This is not indicated as the primary management for hepatic encephalopathy.
- Option B (Paracentesis): Not necessary unless there is evidence of ascites-related symptoms or signs.
- Option C (Administer IV ceftriaxone): No signs of infection, so antibiotics are not indicated.
- Option D (Administer lactulose): Given the patient’s history of constipation and the need to manage hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose is the appropriate initial management.

Answer: D",3266
838,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with finger pain, confusion, progressive memory loss, and small palpable tumors on the fingers. These symptoms suggest a systemic process affecting bone health. The X-ray shows thin bones with brown tumors and osteolysis of the distal phalanges, which are characteristic findings of multiple myeloma. Hyperparathyroidism typically causes hypercalcemia and does not present with palpable tumors. Hypocalcemia usually causes numbness and muscle spasms but not palpable tumors. Osteosarcoma is a primary bone tumor that does not typically present with diffuse bone changes and palpable tumors on the fingers. 

Answer: D",2370
839,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising, along with laboratory findings of a low platelet count and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid, suggest a diagnosis of aplastic crisis in sickle cell disease. The treatment mentioned is hydroxyurea, which is commonly used to increase circulating fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease. This increase in fetal hemoglobin helps prevent sickling of red blood cells and reduces the risk of complications such as aplastic crisis.

Answer: B",1185
840,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient shows a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (Type IV) with a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. This indicates a cell-mediated response rather than an immediate-type (Type I) reaction involving antibodies and histamine release. Eosinophils are not typically involved in Type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells are more relevant to Type I reactions. CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in Type IV hypersensitivity reactions by activating macrophages and producing cytokines. 

Answer: D",1301
841,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a positive fecal occult blood test, a family history of colorectal cancer, and a polyp in the descending colon. The polyp shows 75% tubular architecture, which suggests it is mostly composed of tubular structures, indicative of an adenoma rather than a hamartoma or inflammatory polyp. Given the high percentage of tubular architecture and the presence of a family history, the polyp is most likely an adenomatous polyp, which has a higher risk of malignant transformation compared to inflammatory or hamartomatous polyps.

Answer: B",1377
842,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are consistent with cryptosporidiosis. The symptoms began shortly after eating, suggesting a foodborne illness. Cryptosporidiosis often causes watery diarrhea and can present with abdominal cramps and nausea. The other options are less likely: C. difficile colitis typically presents with more severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea; Bacillus cereus infection usually causes more intense nausea and vomiting but not typically diarrhea; Norovirus infection can cause similar symptoms but is more common in outbreaks rather than individual cases. 

Answer: A",2008
843,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's history of travel to St. Louis, Missouri, and the presence of a cavitary lesion on chest imaging along with necrotic granulomatous inflammation and oval yeast in macrophages strongly suggests histoplasmosis. Onychomycosis and sporotrichosis do not typically present with cavitary lesions. Blastomycosis could present similarly but is less common in urban areas like St. Louis compared to histoplasmosis.

Answer: C",2090
844,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient exhibits features consistent with Turner syndrome, including short stature, low posterior hairline, widely spaced nipples, and other physical anomalies. These findings suggest a 45,X karyotype, which is associated with primary ovarian failure. Therefore, the patient is unlikely to conceive naturally or benefit from gonadotropin administration. The pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is lower compared to patients with primary ovarian failure. 

Answer: C",1741
845,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The perichondrium contains chondrogenic cells that can form chondroblasts, making it a source of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration in cartilage. Proteoglycans are important for cartilage structure but do not have regenerative capacity. Osteoblasts are involved in bone formation and not cartilage. Mature chondrocytes are terminally differentiated and do not regenerate cartilage.

Answer: A",1217
846,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities, urinary incontinence, and a history of previous limb weakness. These symptoms suggest a possible neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases. The presence of urinary incontinence and previous episodes of limb weakness are concerning for a condition affecting the central nervous system. An MRI of the brain and spine would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for potential lesions indicative of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases.

Answer: C",2374
847,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Omeprazole works by inhibiting the H+–K+–ATPase enzyme in the stomach lining, which is responsible for proton pumps. This mechanism is primary active transport. The other options do not accurately describe how omeprazole functions.
Answer: C",1708
848,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling of her hand, with a bluish plaque and central necrosis. This presentation is characteristic of necrotic arachnidism caused by the bite of a brown recluse spider. The striped bark scorpion and diamondback rattlesnake bites typically cause immediate pain and do not present with the specific necrotic changes described. Deer ticks are associated with Lyme disease, not necrotic lesions. Therefore, the most likely cause is a brown recluse spider bite.

Answer: B",1654
849,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Etoposide, the chemotherapy drug used, can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Metoclopramide, an antiemetic, effectively manages these symptoms. The area postrema, located in the medulla oblongata, is known for its role in detecting circulating chemical messengers and triggering vomiting reflexes. The other options (vestibular nerve, intestinal smooth muscle, and vagus nerve) do not directly relate to the specific symptom of vomiting triggered by chemotherapy.

Answer: D",1477
850,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient was struck by a high-voltage power line, resulting in a significant electrical injury. The primary concern in electrical injuries is the risk of internal damage, particularly to the heart and lungs. A FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) ultrasound can quickly assess for free fluid in the abdomen and thorax, indicating potential internal bleeding or cardiac tamponade, both critical conditions in electrical injuries. Urinalysis and X-rays are less urgent in the immediate assessment of electrical injury, and EEG is not indicated for this scenario.

Answer: A",2550
851,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with recurrent shortness of breath, bilateral crackles on lung exam, and lower extremity edema. These findings suggest heart failure. Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is common in heart failure. The patient also has hypovolemia indicated by low ADH, as the body tries to retain fluid. The edema suggests sodium retention, leading to a low sodium level. Potassium levels are typically normal in heart failure unless there is specific renal dysfunction or diuretic use, which is not mentioned here.

Answer: B",2434
852,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and elevated liver enzymes, suggesting acute cholangitis due to a dilated common bile duct stone. This condition requires urgent intervention to prevent complications such as sepsis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can both diagnose and treat the obstruction by removing the stone and placing a stent if necessary. Cholecystectomy is indicated but not immediately urgent unless there is evidence of gallbladder perforation or severe inflammation. Cholecystotomy is rarely used for this purpose and is not the standard approach.

Answer: C",2702
853,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include high fever, rigidity, and non-responsiveness, which are consistent with heat stroke. The patient's refusal to answer questions and suspicion of being spied on are less specific and could be related to mental state rather than a primary diagnosis. While catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome can present with rigidity, the high fever and dry mucous membranes are more indicative of heat stroke. Overdose would typically present with different symptoms such as altered consciousness and respiratory depression, not rigidity and high fever.

Answer: B",1853
854,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient recently had a normal delivery but now presents with abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, and an elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells. These symptoms suggest a postpartum infection, likely involving the uterus. The presence of plasma cells in the lab results indicates a reactive process, often seen in infections. Among the given options, coagulase-positive cocci in clusters (Staphylococcus aureus) are known to cause postpartum infections due to their ability to produce toxins and cause localized infections like endometritis. 

Answer: C",1650
855,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include muscle rigidity, diffuse muscle wasting, inability to stand or sit up straight, and absent reflexes, which are indicative of a lysosomal storage disorder. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine suggests a storage disorder involving glycosaminoglycans. Given the context of arylsulfatase B and A, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a deficiency in arylsulfatase A, as it is involved in the breakdown of cerebroside 3-sulfate. Alpha-galactosidase A and hexosaminidase A are associated with different lysosomal storage disorders (Fabry disease and Gaucher disease, respectively), and beta-galactocerebrosidase is not directly related to the presented symptoms.

Answer: B",2177
856,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of HIV infection and a low CD4+ count, indicating an immunocompromised state. Azithromycin is used for bacterial infections but does not treat HIV. Fluconazole is used for fungal infections and is not indicated here. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a folate derivative often used in combination with methotrexate for cancer chemotherapy but is not a standard treatment for HIV. Tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA) is involved in folate metabolism but is not a treatment for HIV. The standard treatment for HIV includes antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Answer: C",1186
857,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: Aldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. It does this by activating antigen-processing cells, which present antigens to T cells, and by supporting the growth of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells. Given the context of metastatic melanoma and the mechanism of action required, the most accurate description is stimulating antigen-processing cells.

Answer: B",1629
858,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a palpable thyroid nodule with decreased iodine uptake, indicating a reduced function of the nodule compared to the rest of the thyroid gland. Fine-needle aspiration reveals a neoplasm. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is derived from the parafollicular (C细胞) cells, which produce calcitonin and secrete catecholamines, leading to decreased iodine uptake. Papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma typically have normal or increased iodine uptake. Anaplastic carcinoma is highly aggressive and does not specifically correlate with decreased iodine uptake. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Medullary carcinoma.

Answer: B",2485
859,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The medication releases nitric oxide, which increases cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation. This would decrease afterload and reduce the workload on the heart. Therefore, it would not lead to decreased cardiac contractility, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or decreased stroke volume. Instead, it would decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by reducing left ventricular outflow resistance.

Answer: D",1214
860,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient experienced hypotension and tachycardia post-delivery, which are signs of hypovolemic shock. The administration of fluids and blood stabilized her vitals, indicating significant blood loss. The inability to lactate suggests a disruption in the pituitary function, specifically prolactin production. Given the context of a pituitary adenoma, it is plausible that the tumor could have caused compression or invasion of the pituitary gland, leading to hypopituitarism and failure of lactation. The other options do not directly explain the hypotensive episode and the specific issue with lactation.

Answer: A",1495
861,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, jaundice, and splenomegaly. These symptoms suggest a hematologic disorder rather than a gastrointestinal issue like cholecystitis. The Coombs test is negative, ruling out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear is not described, but the other clinical features do not strongly suggest acute myelogenous leukemia or renal papillary necrosis. Given the presence of splenomegaly and anemia, the most likely diagnosis is a hemolytic anemia, which increases the risk of splenic sequestration crisis.

Answer: D",1638
862,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient is 27 years old and has a family history of both colon and breast cancer. Her father died of colon cancer at 68, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 65. Given this significant family history, a colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step to screen for potential early signs of colon cancer. The other options are less relevant: discontinuing birth control and placing an intrauterine device are not indicated based on the information provided; a pap smear is not necessary given her recent negative pap smear result; and weight loss is not indicated without evidence of obesity or related comorbidities.

Answer: A",2004
863,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, along with constricted pupils and cold, pale extremities. These symptoms are highly suggestive of opioid toxicity, given the history of laudanum use. Naloxone is the first-line treatment for opioid overdose to reverse the effects of opioids and alleviate respiratory depression and other symptoms. The other options do not address the primary issue of opioid toxicity.

Answer: A",3395
864,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, rigidity, guarding, and tenderness, along with hemoperitoneum on bedside sonography. These findings are highly suggestive of a solid organ injury, most likely a splenic or liver laceration. The hypotension and tachycardia indicate significant blood loss. Given the hemodynamic instability, a CT scan would not be immediately available, and morphine alone will not address the underlying source of bleeding. A normal saline bolus could potentially mask the true extent of hemorrhage if surgery is needed.

Answer: D",1776
865,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is unresponsive with hypoxemia (oxygen saturation of 73%) despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2. This suggests inadequate oxygen delivery, which could be due to respiratory failure or airway obstruction. Reintubation is the most appropriate next step to ensure secure ventilation and adequate oxygenation.

Answer: C",2814
866,Diagnosis,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include leg swelling, bruising, and an incomplete fracture, along with joint hypermobility and decreased muscle tone. These findings suggest a connective tissue disorder. The blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae could indicate Marfan syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1. This condition often presents with musculoskeletal abnormalities and ocular findings. 

Answer: B",2358
867,Diagnosis,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset swelling and severe pain in the left lower leg, consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His father has a history of pulmonary embolism, indicating a family history of thrombotic disease. The laboratory findings include a positive fibrin split product, which suggests ongoing thrombosis. The ultrasonography shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow, confirming the presence of a DVT.

- **Antithrombin III deficiency**: While it can cause thrombosis, it is less commonly associated with a family history of pulmonary embolism and the specific laboratory findings here.
- **Factor V Leiden**: This mutation is associated with hypercoagulability but typically presents with recurrent venous thromboses rather than a single episode in a young individual without a strong family history.
- **Protein C deficiency**: This condition is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and the patient’s family history and clinical presentation fit well.
- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: This condition involves antiphospholipid antibodies and can present with thrombosis and pregnancy-related complications, but the patient’s history does not suggest these features.

Answer: C",2209
868,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a slow heart rate (48/min) and hypotension (89/50 mm Hg), indicating bradyarrhythmia. The ECG shows a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave being nonconducted, suggesting second-degree AV block, type II. This condition can cause hemodynamic instability. Given the patient's symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness, and the presence of a nonconducted P wave pattern, a pacemaker is the most appropriate next step to restore normal heart rhythm and improve hemodynamics.

Answer: C",2021
869,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The study follows a cohort of alcohol users and non-users to observe the development of GERD. The fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol is no longer consumed can be calculated by comparing the incidence of GERD in alcohol users versus non-users.

- Option A: \( \frac{45}{195} \) - This represents the proportion of people who did not develop GERD among those who did, which is not relevant to the prevention fraction.
- Option B: \( \frac{30}{400} \) - This represents the incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics, which does not represent the prevention fraction.
- Option C: \( \frac{\frac{30}{200}}{\frac{30}{400}} \) - This ratio does not represent the prevention fraction directly.
- Option D: \( \frac{30}{200} \) - This represents the incidence of GERD in alcohol users, which can be used to calculate the prevention fraction.

The prevention fraction is calculated as the difference in incidence rates between alcohol users and non-users. Here, the incidence of GERD in alcohol users is \( \frac{30}{200} = 0.15 \) and in non-users is \( \frac{30}{400} = 0.075 \). The fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol is no longer consumed is \( \frac{0.15 - 0.075}{0.15} = \frac{30/200}{30/400} \), but the direct fraction is \( \frac{30}{200} \).

Answer: D",1746
870,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and an urgent need to defecate. These symptoms suggest active inflammation and bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The history of bulimia with laxative abuse is not directly related to these gastrointestinal symptoms. The physical examination shows a mildly pale conjunctiva and a tender, erythematous rectum. Colonoscopy reveals continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure, which is characteristic of ulcerative colitis. 

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Typically presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits without continuous mucosal lesions.
- **Celiac disease**: Usually presents with chronic symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, but not typically with grossly bloody stool or continuous mucosal lesions.
- **Crohn’s disease**: Can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, but the lesions are typically patchy and not continuous throughout the colon.

Answer: A",2037
871,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with chronic pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation, which are consistent with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). The absence of fever, no evidence of bacterial infection on culture, and the presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion support this diagnosis. Benign prostatic hyperplasia typically does not present with these specific symptoms, and interstitial cystitis usually involves bladder symptoms rather than pelvic pain. There is no indication of a resistant Escherichia coli infection.

Answer: B",2082
872,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The splenic artery arises from the celiac trunk and supplies the spleen, pancreas, stomach, and parts of the duodenum. Ligation of the splenic artery at its origin will affect these areas. The left gastric artery, left gastroepiploic artery, and common hepatic artery are all branches of the celiac trunk but do not receive direct supply from the splenic artery. The gastroduodenal artery, however, receives its blood supply from the common hepatic artery, which is not affected by the ligation. Therefore, the gastroduodenal artery will be hypoperfused.

Answer: B",1324
873,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The newborn is born to a mother with known hepatitis B, indicating a high risk of vertical transmission. The infant has a low birth weight and hypotension, but no signs of severe liver dysfunction or other critical conditions. The APGAR scores are within acceptable limits, and there are no obvious signs of neonatal hepatitis. Given the mother's hepatitis B status, the best course of action is to prevent potential infection in the newborn. Administering both the hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG is the standard protocol to prevent perinatally acquired hepatitis B.

Answer: C",2323
874,Treatment,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient had a recent history of fever, chills, and cough, which suggests a possible bacterial pneumonia. Although his current symptoms are primarily a chronic cough and occasional blood-tinged sputum, these could indicate ongoing inflammation or infection. Given the context of a recent respiratory illness, a chest radiograph is the best next step to evaluate for any residual or new lung pathology. The other options are less appropriate: D-dimer is not indicated for ruling out pneumonia; sputum culture would be more relevant if there were signs of active infection; and supportive care alone does not address the need for further diagnostic evaluation.

Answer: A",1900
875,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has sudden urges to urinate and involuntary leakage without incontinence during activities like coughing or laughing. This suggests detrusor overactivity, a common symptom in multiple sclerosis. Midodrine is used for orthostatic hypotension and urinary incontinence, but it does not target detrusor overactivity. Rivastigmine treats dementia-related conditions but does not address urinary incontinence. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant and does not specifically treat urinary incontinence. Tolterodine is a antimuscarinic that effectively manages detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence.
Answer: D",1894
876,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head, which suggests a possible migraine. She has not responded to ibuprofen, indicating that a stronger medication may be needed. Sumatriptan is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraines and is more effective than other treatments for this condition. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for preventing migraines but is not typically used for acute treatment. No treatment is not an option given the severity of her pain. 100% oxygen is sometimes used for post-dural puncture headache but not for migraines.

Answer: D",2354
877,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a data set. Looking at the respiratory rates provided, we see that 32 breaths per minute occurs three times, which is more frequent than any other rate. Therefore, the mode is 32 breaths per minute.
Answer: B",1542
878,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's amputated finger should be kept cool and moist to preserve the tissue. Ice water can cause frostbite and damage the tissue further. Therefore, options A and D are incorrect. Moist gauze alone without cooling does not provide adequate preservation. Option B is insufficient as it does not include cooling. Option C combines moist gauze with cooling in a plastic bag, which is the correct method.

Answer: C",1833
879,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of irregular menstrual cycles and has recently started having sexual intercourse. Her prolactin level is elevated (16 ng/mL), which could indicate a pituitary adenoma. However, her thyroid-stimulating hormone is slightly elevated (3.8 μU/mL), suggesting hypothyroidism, which can also cause amenorrhea. Her progesterone level is low (0.8 ng/mL), indicating anovulation. Given her recent sexual activity and the absence of other significant findings, the most likely cause of her symptoms is anovulation.

Answer: D",2448
880,Mechanism,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure and facial flushing. These symptoms are not typical of Marfan syndrome (B) or Turner syndrome (C), which primarily affect the skeletal and cardiovascular systems but do not commonly present with isolated hypertension or facial flushing. Takayasu's arteritis (D) can cause hypertension due to aortic arch involvement but does not typically present with facial flushing. Fibromuscular dysplasia (A) is a benign condition characterized by abnormal development of the muscular walls of arteries, often presenting with intermittent hypertension, palpitations, and headaches. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that an echocardiogram is ordered, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A",2007
881,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of testicular cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. The presence of fine inspiratory crackles, bilateral clubbing, and pulmonary function tests showing normal FVC but reduced FEV1/FVC ratio suggest interstitial lung disease. Among the chemotherapy drugs listed, Cisplatin is known to cause interstitial lung disease as a common side effect. Bleomycin and carboplatin are less commonly associated with this specific lung condition. Ifosfamide is not typically linked to interstitial lung disease. Therefore, Cisplatin is the most likely drug responsible for the patient’s condition.

Answer: C",1388
882,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient developed reduced urine output and elevated serum creatinine post-hospitalization, suggesting acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the recent initiation of multiple medications (ketoprofen, piperacillin, tazobactam), the most likely cause is an adverse drug reaction. Gastrointestinal blood loss would typically present with hematochezia or melena, not just proteinuria. Dehydration is less likely given the normal blood pressure and absence of other signs of fluid loss. Contrast administration would be more relevant if a contrast-enhanced imaging study was performed, but no such information is provided. Therefore, the adverse drug reaction is the most probable cause.

Answer: B",2532
883,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: Inflammasomes are involved in the activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-interleukin-1β and pro-interleukin-18 into their active forms. The described process involves NLRP3, ASC, and the pyrin domain, which are key components in forming the inflammasome complex. Caspase 1 is the next enzyme to be activated in this pathway. Adenosine deaminase, protein phosphatase, and tyrosine kinase do not play a direct role in the activation of inflammasomes.
Answer: B",1672
884,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is studded with ribosomes and is responsible for the synthesis and modification of secreted proteins and membrane proteins. Protein-secreting cells, such as those in the pancreas or salivary glands, require the RER for proper protein synthesis and secretion. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in lipid metabolism and detoxification but not in protein synthesis. The cytosol and nucleus do not have ribosomes attached and thus are not sites of protein synthesis.

Answer: A",1150
885,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe headache, slurring of speech, left-sided facial droop, and left upper extremity weakness. These symptoms are consistent with a stroke, either hemorrhagic or ischemic. However, the patient's history of multiple hospital admissions for panic attacks and suicide attempts suggests a possible psychogenic cause. The rapid onset of symptoms after taking additional doses of sumatriptan, along with the administration of dihydroergotamine and IV fluids, does not support a medication reaction. Given the patient's recent history and the specific neurological deficits, the most likely cause is a stroke. The presence of a thrombus leading to ischemia is more plausible than a hemorrhagic stroke based on the context.

Answer: B",2665
886,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 24-year-old woman with no current symptoms of infection or abnormal bleeding. Her last Pap smear was normal two years ago, and she has no recent risk factors for cervical cancer. She is planning a backpacking trip but there is no indication of travel-related health concerns requiring specific testing. Given her routine visit and no recent changes in her health status, routine screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is not indicated at this time. A beta-hCG test is not necessary as she is not pregnant based on her history. Therefore, no further testing is necessary at this visit.

Answer: D",2153
887,Mechanism,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presented with a significant drop in blood pressure and tachycardia, along with shortness of breath and wheezing, which suggests an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. This is often triggered by a transfusion reaction, especially if the patient has pre-existing conditions like asthma or a history of allergies. The sudden onset of these symptoms after a blood transfusion points towards an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, which can cause anaphylactic shock. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation.

Answer: D",3146
888,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The p-value of 0.03 indicates the probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis (no association between prior cesarian birth and placenta accreta) is true. It does not represent the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis being true or false. The 99% confidence interval would exclude the null hypothesis if it did not include 1, but we do not have information on the confidence interval here. The p-value does not directly translate to the chance of bias; it measures statistical significance, not the probability of bias. 

Answer: C",2039
889,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with gum bleeding, a family history of similar problems, and laboratory findings consistent with a coagulation disorder. The decreased factor VIII activity and ristocetin cofactor assay suggest a defect in von Willebrand factor, which is often associated with bleeding disorders like von Willebrand disease. The bleeding time and prothrombin time are within normal limits, ruling out deficiencies in factors involved in early platelet adhesion and coagulation. Factor XI is not directly implicated in the described bleeding manifestations, and there is no indication of vitamin K deficiency or antithrombin III involvement.

Answer: C",2001
890,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of a Colles' fracture, a family history of osteoporosis, and a low DEXA score (-3.2 SDs), indicating significant osteoporosis. The primary treatment for osteoporosis includes bisphosphonates like alendronate, which directly target bone metabolism to reduce fracture risk. Calcitonin can be used but is not as potent as bisphosphonates. Estrogen and tamoxifen are used for osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal women but are not typically first-line treatments for established osteoporosis. Therefore, alendronate is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy.

Answer: A",2075
891,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is at 26 weeks' gestation, which is too early for vaginal delivery (options A and B). Nifedipine therapy (option C) is used for preterm labor to delay delivery, but the cervix is already dilated to 5 cm, indicating active labor rather than preterm labor. Dilation and evacuation (option D) is typically used for second-trimester abortions, which is not indicated here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to allow vaginal delivery.

Answer: A",2315
892,Mechanism,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient's history of heavy alcohol use (5-8 drinks/day for 20 years) and the presence of bilateral pitting edema and bibasilar crackles suggest chronic heart failure secondary to alcohol abuse. Chronic alcohol abuse leads to cardiomyopathy, which can cause heart failure. In heart failure, there is increased venous pressure leading to edema and pulmonary congestion causing crackles. This condition is not associated with decreased GFR, decreased ECF volume, or increased renal blood flow or tubular sodium reabsorption.

Answer: A",2107
893,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with puncture wounds and localized cellulitis, which suggests a bacterial infection likely from the dog bite. Given the severity (cellulitis), it is important to cover a broad spectrum of bacteria, including anaerobes. Amoxicillin alone may not be sufficient due to potential anaerobic coverage. Amoxicillin-clavulanate provides broader coverage, including anaerobes. Clindamycin is effective against anaerobes but does not cover the full range of bacteria typically involved in such infections. Doxycycline is more commonly used for rickettsial infections and certain skin conditions rather than post-bite infections. Therefore, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: B",1946
894,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient is a 3-year-old refugee with a history of frequent displacement and inadequate nutrition. The symptoms include pitting edema, ascites, hepatomegaly, and missing teeth. These findings are consistent with severe malnutrition. 

- **Kwashiorkor** involves protein deficiency with adequate energy intake, often presenting with edema, dermatological changes, and growth retardation. The presence of ascites and hepatomegaly suggests more severe systemic involvement, fitting better with severe malnutrition.
- **Marasmus** involves inadequate energy intake, leading to weight loss and wasting. While it can cause edema, the specific combination of ascites, hepatomegaly, and severe systemic symptoms is more indicative of kwashiorkor.
- **Beriberi** is related to thiamine deficiency and typically presents with neurological symptoms like irritability, confusion, and paresis, along with cardiomyopathy or peripheral neuropathy. The patient's presentation does not align with these features.
- **Rickets** involves vitamin D or calcium deficiency, leading to bone deformities and pain, not the systemic findings described.

Answer: A",1983
895,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a limited vocabulary and speech development issues, but no significant motor deficits. His face appears long and narrow, suggesting a possible genetic syndrome. Given the symptoms and the referral to a geneticist for a trinucleotide repeat disorder, the inheritance pattern is more likely to be autosomal dominant rather than recessive because only one copy of the allele is needed to express the disorder. There is no indication of X-linked inheritance or noninherited somatic mutations. 

Answer: A",2411
896,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include delusions of being watched by aliens and having his thoughts stolen, which are fixed false beliefs. These delusions do not fit the criteria for a mood disorder with psychotic features (option B). Schizoid personality disorder (option C) is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships and a preference for a solitary lifestyle, but the patient's delusions and anxiety are not consistent with this diagnosis. Schizophrenia (option D) typically involves more prominent positive symptoms like hallucinations and disorganized speech, which are not mentioned here. The patient's delusions are the primary symptom, fitting the criteria for delusional disorder.

Answer: A",1822
897,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient developed pitting edema and proteinuria, indicating potential kidney involvement. The presence of diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization suggests bladder toxicity, specifically from cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, as these drugs require mesna to prevent such toxicities. Since the patient was not on mesna, the condition could have been prevented by its use. Methotrexate and nitrofurantoin do not typically cause this specific set of symptoms. Therefore, mesna could have prevented the patient’s condition.

Answer: B",2172
898,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's behavior indicates a strong aversion to social situations, difficulty leaving the house, and a desire to avoid social gatherings despite a wish for relationships. This aligns with the characteristics of avoidant personality disorder, which involves fear of rejection and a preference for avoiding social interactions. Schizoid personality disorder involves a lack of interest in social relationships and emotional detachment, which does not fit the patient's desire for relationships. Antisocial personality disorder involves a disregard for the rights of others and a lack of empathy, which is not present here. Agoraphobia involves fear of specific situations, but the patient's fear seems more generalized to social interactions rather than specific places or situations.
Answer: B",2499
899,Mechanism,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient is lethargic, grasping at his ears, and swaying, which suggests a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect. The presence of multiple pill bottles including lorazepam indicates a possible benzodiazepine overdose. Lorazepam can cause respiratory depression and metabolic acidosis due to its effect on the CNS and metabolism. The ABG showing a pH < 7.35, PCO2 > 25 mmHg, and HCO3- < 22 mEq/L is consistent with metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis secondary to hypoventilation. 

Answer: B",2069
900,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath, along with low hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, and MCH levels, indicating microcytic hypochromic anemia. The low transferrin saturation and normal TIBC suggest iron deficiency anemia. Given the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the low reticulocyte count, the bone marrow biopsy would likely show hypocellularity with fatty infiltration, as chronic kidney disease can lead to decreased bone marrow activity and fibrosis.

Answer: A",1777
901,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing profuse bleeding, hypotension, and an abnormal ultrasound showing an intrauterine gestational sac without fetal movement or cardiac activity. These findings suggest a possible missed abortion or incomplete miscarriage. Given the patient's symptoms and the lack of fetal viability, dilation and curettage (D&C) is the most appropriate next step to remove any remaining tissue and prevent complications such as infection or continued bleeding.

Answer: D",2811
902,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with pain and swelling in multiple joints, a tender pustule, and cloudy arthrocentesis fluid with high neutrophil count and intracellular organisms. These findings suggest an infectious process rather than an autoimmune one. There is no mention of IV drug use or HLA-B 27 positivity. The history of recent camping and the presence of a pustule are more consistent with a sexually transmitted infection, given the context of potential exposure. Therefore, the strongest risk factor is a sexually transmitted infection.

Answer: C",1773
903,Mechanism,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of frequent chest pain and epigastric burning following food ingestion are consistent with GERD. The new medication is likely targeting the acid production in the stomach. Cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, was previously used but did not fully control the symptoms. The most effective treatment for GERD involves inhibiting H+/K+-ATPase, which is the mechanism of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This mechanism provides stronger acid suppression compared to H2 receptor antagonists.

Answer: B",1699
904,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with periorbital edema and pitting edema, which are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. The electron microscopy finding of podocyte foot process effacement is characteristic of minimal change nephropathy, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins are typically seen in glomerulonephritis, which does not fit the context of minimal change nephropathy. White blood cell casts and eosinophils suggest infection or allergic interstitial nephritis, which is not indicated by the clinical presentation. Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells are more indicative of tubular injury, which is not the primary issue here.

Answer: A",1984
905,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The scenario describes a situation where earlier detection of nephrolithiasis through point-of-care ultrasound leads to a perception of better outcomes (lower radiation exposure and no difference in complications or pain) but does not actually extend survival or improve the underlying condition. This aligns with lead-time bias, where the apparent improvement in outcomes is due to earlier detection rather than a true change in the natural history of the disease.

Answer: C",2551
906,Diagnosis,False,A,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with intermittent chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss. These symptoms suggest a possible underlying cardiac condition. The echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, indicating heart failure. Additionally, there is a mass in the left atrium, which is biopsied. Given the presence of an irregularly irregular rhythm (suggesting atrial fibrillation) and a mid-diastolic murmur (indicating a left-sided valvular lesion), the mass is likely a myxoma, which is a benign tumor commonly found in the left atrium and characterized by a gelatinous appearance and mesenchymal cell clusters.

Answer: A",1674
907,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness, shortness of breath, and palpitations suggest possible angina pectoris. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading would likely place her in Class II or III based on her symptoms. Given the absence of clear gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, an upper endoscopy (Option B) is not indicated. Coronary angiography (Option C) is too invasive and not necessary for initial evaluation. Echocardiography at rest (Option D) does not assess coronary perfusion and is less specific for diagnosing angina compared to stress testing. A myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress (Option A) can visualize myocardial perfusion and identify areas of ischemia, making it the most appropriate next step.

Answer: A",2512
908,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria and treated with amoxicillin 2 weeks ago. There are no current symptoms, and the physical examination is unremarkable. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy requires treatment to prevent complications such as pyelonephritis. However, routine urinalysis on each subsequent antenatal visit is not necessary if the patient remains asymptomatic. Performing a urine culture again would be redundant given recent treatment and absence of symptoms. Checking for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria via urinalysis is appropriate if there are signs of infection, but it is not the most accurate statement for this case.

Answer: D",2377
909,Diagnosis,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The baby exhibits upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a flat facial profile, small ears, a single palmar crease, and hypotonia. These features are characteristic of Down syndrome, a chromosomal disorder involving trisomy 21. 

- Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect, not related to the facial and palmar features.
- Omphalocele involves abdominal wall defects, not facial or palmar features.
- Congenital cataracts can occur in Down syndrome but are not the primary feature.
- Cleft lip involves a cleft in the upper lip, not present here.

Answer: C",1984
910,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's headache is diffuse, dull, and worse in the morning, without associated symptoms like fever, photophobia, or phonophobia. The presence of mild bilateral papilledema suggests increased intracranial pressure. The MRI shows a solitary lesion with predominant hemorrhage in the left temporal region. This presentation is more consistent with a metastatic lesion rather than primary brain tumors. Among the given options, melanoma is the most likely to cause such a lesion due to its propensity to metastasize to the brain, especially in patients with a history of cutaneous or mucosal melanoma. Lung cancer and thyroid cancer are less likely to present with a solitary hemorrhagic lesion in the temporal region without other systemic symptoms. Multiple myeloma typically presents with bone lesions rather than brain metastases.

Answer: B",2182
911,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient is being treated for depression and is also trying to quit smoking. Bupropion is commonly used for both these conditions. Bupropion is known to cause QT prolongation, which can lead to tachycardias and torsades de pointes. The other options (hypotension, urinary retention, and tachycardia) are not primary side effects of bupropion.

Answer: D",2006
912,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative, non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive bacterium. The culture characteristics of H. influenzae typically do not include pink colonies, blue-green pigment, or yellow sulfur granules. However, it can produce a red pigment known as vicinal diphosphatase, which gives colonies a red color. Since the culture yielded motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive, the most common finding would be red pigment.

Answer: D",2021
913,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include fever, malaise, dyspnea, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain, along with focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. These symptoms suggest a bacterial pneumonia. The family history of cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease indicates potential underlying lung conditions. The protein identified in her serum binds strongly to a protein on the surface of her neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting an immune response. V(D)J recombination specifically occurs during the development of lymphocytes and is not involved in the immediate immune response to bacterial infections. Isotype switching is a process that occurs in B cells to produce different classes of antibodies, which is not directly related to the binding of proteins to neutrophils and macrophages. Random assortment is a term used in genetics, not in the context of immune responses. Therefore, the process that typically undergoes this binding is V(D)J recombination.

Answer: C",2132
914,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The rigidity observed in the body is rigor mortis, which occurs after death due to the depletion of ATP and subsequent inhibition of cross-bridge cycling in muscles. Neurotoxins from the coral snake would affect neuromuscular transmission but not directly cause rigor mortis. Low temperature affects flexibility but not the immediate onset of rigidity. Depletion of intracellular calcium would affect muscle contraction but not the post-mortem rigidity seen here.

Answer: C",2309
915,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can have several effects, including hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia, aplastic crisis in the neonate, and a typical slapped-cheek rash in the neonate. However, the incidence of fetal loss in primary infections is generally lower than 40%. The patient's symptoms (malaise, joint pain, fever, chills, and a lace-like rash) are consistent with parvovirus B19 infection. 

Answer: A",1983
916,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with substernal chest pain, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking, all of which are risk factors for coronary artery disease. The initial ECG showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, which are indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the chest pain resolved and the repeat ECG showed no abnormalities, suggesting that the initial presentation was likely due to a transient event rather than a complete infarction. Given the patient's history and the transient nature of the symptoms, the most likely underlying mechanism is atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which can cause transient ischemia without permanent damage if the blood flow is quickly restored.

Answer: C",1907
917,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has episodes of hypoglycemia with low glucose, high insulin, and low C-peptide levels, indicating an insulin excess without adequate insulin-stimulated insulin secretion. This pattern is consistent with insulin resistance or overproduction, which points towards factitious disorder imposed on another (malingering or factitious disorder). Malingering involves intentional fabrication of symptoms for personal gain, while conversion disorder presents with neurological symptoms without organic cause. Primary adrenal insufficiency would not cause high insulin levels. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another.

Answer: D",2065
918,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and a distended urinary bladder. These symptoms suggest urinary retention, which is confirmed by the palpable bladder in the suprapubic region. The presence of a distended bladder indicates obstruction or impaired bladder emptying. Given the patient's history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can lead to neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction, along with the neurological findings of decreased Achilles reflexes and diminished sensory function, the most likely cause is diabetic neuropathy affecting bladder function. 

Bladder catheterization is the immediate step to relieve the urinary retention and prevent complications such as infection or bladder rupture. Vaginal pessaries and cystostomies are not indicated for urinary retention due to neurogenic causes. Prostaglandin E2 is not typically used for urinary retention.

Answer: B",2539
919,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient describes electrical pain in the buttocks that can travel down the leg, which suggests sciatica or radiculopathy. The straight leg raise test is commonly used to diagnose sciatic nerve compression. The other tests do not specifically target nerve root compression. 

Answer: B",2166
920,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and difficulty swallowing, along with an upper esophageal web on imaging. These symptoms are characteristic of Plummer-Vinson syndrome, which includes dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia, and upper esophageal webs. The other options are less likely because:
- Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma typically causes more severe symptoms and does not present with an upper esophageal web.
- Zenker’s diverticulum is associated with pain behind the sternum and regurgitation, not dysphagia alone.
- Achalasia would present with progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids without the specific finding of an upper esophageal web.
Answer: A",2069
921,Mechanism,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include blurred vision, narrowing of retinal arteries, and microaneurysms, which are indicative of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy involves changes in the retinal vasculature and can be associated with increased levels of sorbitol due to impaired glucose metabolism. Galactocerebrosidase and arylsulfatase A are involved in different metabolic pathways and do not directly affect retinal vasculature. Sphingomyelinase is involved in sphingolipid metabolism but does not specifically relate to retinal changes. Therefore, the most likely enzyme involved in these tissue-specific changes is Sorbitol dehydrogenase.

Answer: A",1860
922,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. These symptoms suggest an underlying immunodeficiency or chronic inflammatory condition. 

- **Chronic granulomatous disease** (CGD) is characterized by recurrent infections due to defective NADPH oxidase, leading to impaired production of reactive oxygen species. The symptoms match well with the patient's history of recurrent infections and skin lesions.

- **Atopic dermatitis** (AD) typically presents with itchy, red, and scaly skin lesions, not the recurrent infections and enlarged lymph nodes seen here.

- **Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome** involves thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections, but the patient does not have thrombocytopenia or eczema.

- **Chédiak-Higashi syndrome** involves recurrent infections, but the patient does not have the characteristic features like petechiae or specific hematologic abnormalities.

Answer: A",1834
923,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for the initial phase of shoulder abduction. A tear in this muscle would lead to weakness in initiating abduction. The patient's history of chronic shoulder pain and acute exacerbation after a basketball game suggests a possible supraspinatus tear. The acute strain during the game likely exacerbated any pre-existing weakness.

Answer: C",1506
924,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with left knee pain, stiffness, and tenderness, particularly in the anteromedial joint line, along with crepitus and pain during full flexion and extension. These symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis. The serum uric acid level of 8.0 mg/dL is elevated, suggesting possible gout, but the clinical presentation is more indicative of osteoarthritis. Imaging findings in osteoarthritis typically show osteophytes and joint-space narrowing, while gout would show diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions or fluid-filled pouches on ultrasound. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms and the absence of acute inflammatory signs, joint effusion, or pannus, the most likely finding on imaging would be osteophytes with joint-space narrowing.

Answer: A",2485
925,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has recurrent bacterial infections, light-colored skin, and silver-colored hair, along with large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils. These findings are characteristic of Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, which involves mutations in the LYST gene leading to cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils. AIDS and common variable immunodeficiency do not typically present with cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 does not involve recurrent bacterial infections or cytoplasmic vacuoles.

Answer: C",1622
926,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has an amputated foot stump that is erythematous and edematous, along with sinus tachycardia and difficulty breathing. These symptoms suggest possible sepsis from the amputated foot. Option A (complete blood count, type and screen, and order 1 unit of blood) is not the immediate priority as it does not address the underlying cause. Option C (deep wound culture and start piperacillin-tazobactam) is appropriate but should be done after stabilizing the patient. Option D (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and give oxycodone) is not indicated as the patient's primary issue is respiratory distress. Option B (CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen) addresses the respiratory distress and can help identify any pulmonary issues.

Answer: B",1697
927,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of sudden severe pain in the right great toe, along with a high serum uric acid level and cloudy synovial fluid with neutrophil predominance, suggest gout. The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for gout involves reducing uric acid levels to prevent future attacks. Among the options, only allopurinol and probenecid work by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which reduces uric acid production. Hydrochlorothiazide increases uric acid levels, so it would not be appropriate. Therefore, the mechanism of action for the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy is inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

Answer: C",1828
928,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient is experiencing severe anaphylaxis with hypotension and respiratory distress. Labetalol is a beta-blocker, which could exacerbate hypotension and bradycardia. Glucagon, dexamethasone, and norepinephrine are not first-line treatments for anaphylaxis. Dopamine can be used to increase blood pressure by stimulating both alpha and beta receptors, making it a suitable choice to manage hypotension in anaphylaxis.
Answer: A",2197
929,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Drug X blocks the androgen receptor, which fits the description of an antiandrogen. Leuprolide is a GnRH analogue that reduces testosterone levels but does not block the androgen receptor directly. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces DHT levels but does not block the androgen receptor. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used for breast cancer and does not affect androgens. Flutamide is an antiandrogen that competes with androgens for interaction with the androgen receptor, fitting the description of drug X.

Answer: C",1814
930,Treatment,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's sudden onset of paralysis affecting multiple muscle groups, including those involved in facial movement, chewing, swallowing, and speech, suggests a rapid correction of an electrolyte imbalance leading to neuromuscular irritability. Among the options, hyponatremia (A) and hypernatremia (B) do not typically cause such acute neuromuscular symptoms. Hypokalemia (C) and hypochloremia (D) can lead to neuromuscular irritability and weakness, but hypokalemia is more commonly associated with muscle weakness rather than facial and oropharyngeal involvement. Given the context of acute correction, hypochloremia (D) is the most likely candidate as it can cause neuromuscular irritability and fits the clinical presentation better than the others.

Answer: D",1567
931,Treatment,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The patient had a positive tuberculin skin test and was treated with an antimycobacterial drug. This suggests an initial diagnosis of tuberculosis. Two months later, he developed symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, including numbness, burning, and decreased sensation. These symptoms are consistent with leprosy (Hansen's disease), which can present similarly but is less common than other causes. The other options (accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine, intracellular accumulation of sorbitol, impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP) are not typically associated with the presentation of peripheral neuropathy following tuberculosis treatment.

Answer: C",1808
932,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral knee pain, worsening with activity and alleviated by rest, tenderness, crepitus, and decreased range of motion. These symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis. Given the clinical presentation, an MRI of the knee would provide detailed imaging to assess joint damage and guide treatment decisions. While a CBC and ESR can indicate inflammation, they are not specific for osteoarthritis. No further work-up is indicated if the diagnosis is clear based on clinical findings.

Answer: C",1706
933,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with pallor, rash, petechiae, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. These findings are consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are hallmark features of TTP. The history of a recent febrile illness and rash also supports this diagnosis. While disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can present similarly, the lack of significant bleeding and the presence of schistocytes make TTP more likely. Escherichia coli infection and immune thrombocytopenic purpura do not fit the clinical presentation as well.

Answer: D",2228
934,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient has refused life-prolonging treatments and requested palliative care without significant healthcare costs. Hospice care is typically indicated for patients with a life expectancy of 6 months or less who prefer palliative care. Since the patient has already expressed a clear preference for palliative care and has no life-prolonging treatments planned, he meets the criteria for hospice care without needing further steps to determine his life expectancy or the presence of metastasis.

Answer: D",2406
935,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The complete blood count shows an absolute increase in the cells, indicating an elevated white blood cell count. This suggests leukocytosis. Leukocytes are the most common type of white blood cells and typically constitute about 40-70% of the total leukocyte count. Macrophages are derived from monocytes, not directly from leukocytes, so option A is incorrect. CD25 is typically expressed on regulatory T cells, not all leukocytes, making option B incorrect. Option C states that leukocytes normally constitute 25-40% of the total leukocyte count, which is inaccurate; they usually make up a larger proportion. Lymphocytes, which have a lymphoid origin, are a type of leukocyte but do not normally constitute 25-40% of the total leukocyte count. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as leukocytes have a hematopoietic origin, not a lymphoid one.

Answer: D",2559
936,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated, along with a history of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. These symptoms are highly suggestive of appendicitis. An abdominal radiograph may show non-specific findings, β-hCG is used for pregnancy testing, and a stool occult blood test is more relevant for gastrointestinal bleeding rather than appendicitis. A CT scan is the most accurate imaging modality for diagnosing appendicitis.

Answer: C",2031
937,Diagnosis,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient is gravida 2 para 0, indicating she has not given birth before (nulliparity). Her history includes a stillbirth in her previous pregnancy and preeclampsia in her sister's pregnancies. These factors suggest a higher risk for preeclampsia or similar conditions in her current pregnancy. The current symptoms of nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are consistent with preeclampsia or its progression to eclampsia. The patient's age (24 years) and nulliparity do not directly correlate with the specific risk factors mentioned. The history of preeclampsia in her sibling is a strong indicator of genetic predisposition to the condition.

Answer: D",2383
938,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent episodes of dark urine and fatigue, which are suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. The recent initiation of glipizide, a medication known to cause rhabdomyolysis, along with the patient's history of poorly controlled type II diabetes, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's dietary habits and recent尝试翻译

Here is the correct translation and completion:

Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent episodes of dark urine and fatigue, which are suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. The recent initiation of glipizide, a medication known to cause rhabdomyolysis, along with the patient's history of poorly controlled type II diabetes, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's dietary habits and recent exposure to a new type of food (Lebanese cuisine) do not directly correlate with rhabdomyolysis. Bacterial infections typically present with fever, localized pain, and other systemic symptoms, making them less likely. Idiopathic cases are rare and would not explain the recurrent nature of the symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause is the medication.

Answer: C",2129
939,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fatigue, joint pain, erythema with scaling on both cheeks (butterfly rash), and oral ulcers, which are classic symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These findings suggest an autoimmune disorder rather than a hematologic or thrombotic condition. Decreased gamma globulin levels could indicate a primary immunodeficiency, but given the context of SLE, other laboratory findings such as decreased lymphocytes or increased platelets are more likely. Increased prothrombin time suggests a coagulopathy, which is not typical in SLE. Therefore, the most likely finding is a decreased lymphocyte count.
Answer: A",2065
940,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea on exertion and bilateral lower extremity edema, along with an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). These findings suggest right-sided heart failure, where increased capillary pressure in the lungs and systemic circulation leads to fluid accumulation in the lower extremities. This aligns best with option A.

Answer: A",1597
941,Diagnosis,False,D,A,"Reasoning: The patient's smoking history and alcohol consumption suggest an increased risk for conditions associated with these habits. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is linked to smoking but not directly to alcohol consumption. Esophageal varices are more commonly associated with portal hypertension and cirrhosis, not directly with alcohol or smoking. Porcelain gallbladder is a rare condition related to chronic inflammation and gallstones, not directly linked to alcohol or smoking. Hepatic steatosis (fatty liver disease) is strongly associated with both heavy alcohol use and smoking, making it the most relevant risk factor for this patient.

Answer: D",1308
942,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Cushing's syndrome, including weight gain, central obesity, increased hair growth, and muscle weakness. The low potassium level (2.8 mEq/L) and high glucose level (236 mg/dL) further support this diagnosis. ACTH levels are low (2 pg/mL), suggesting an adrenal source rather than a pituitary cause. Given the adrenal origin, the most appropriate treatment is adrenalectomy.

Answer: A",2204
943,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: Myocyte relaxation involves the removal of calcium ions from the cytoplasm, which leads to the relaxation of the muscle fiber. Influx of sodium ions (A) and calcium ions from the sacroplasmic reticulum (B) would cause depolarization and contraction, not relaxation. Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte (C) would also cause contraction. Only the efflux of calcium ions (D) directly contributes to relaxation by reducing the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm.

Answer: D",1480
944,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps, along with hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9 mEq/L). These symptoms suggest hyperkalemia, which can be caused by various factors including chemotherapy, certain medications, and underlying conditions like renal dysfunction. Allopurinol can cause hyperkalemia as a side effect, and given the patient's recent chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia, this is a plausible cause. Rasburicase is used for tumor lysis syndrome prevention but does not directly address hyperkalemia. Urine alkalinization and intravenous hydration can help manage hyperkalemia but are not as targeted as allopurinol withdrawal or rasburicase.

Answer: C",2391
945,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The context mentions an ultrasound examination for a 23-year-old woman with overdue menses. The structure marked with the green arrow is likely the uterus, as it is the primary site of endometrial tissue growth during menstruation. Given the options, the uterus does not remove nitrogenous waste (A), is not involved in hematopoiesis (B), nor produces amniotic fluid (C). The function of the uterus is to facilitate gas exchange is not accurate; gas exchange occurs in the lungs. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D",1205
946,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with multiple falls, dizziness, a wide-based gait, and an inability to stand with feet together without support. These symptoms suggest a disturbance in balance and coordination. The coarse tremor of the hands and impaired rapid alternating movements further indicate a problem with the cerebellum. The patient's history of daily rum consumption and working in an environment that could expose him to toxic substances are concerning for a nutritional or toxic cause of cerebellar degeneration. Korsakoff syndrome typically presents with memory deficits and confabulation, methanol poisoning would present with visual disturbances and metabolic acidosis, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, while related to thiamine deficiency, primarily affects the thalamus and hypothalamus, presenting with ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and confusion rather than the cerebellar signs noted.

Answer: C",2641
947,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient is 7 years old with Tanner stage 3 breast development and pubic hair, indicating early signs of puberty. However, she has only recently started her menstrual period, suggesting delayed puberty. Given this context, the most concerning long-term issue is delayed skeletal maturity, as it can lead to shorter adult height. Short stature is a potential concern but is not specifically linked to the timing of puberty. Genu varum (bowlegs) and coarse facial features are not directly related to the described pubertal development issues.

Answer: A",1812
948,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of STEMI, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. His current presentation includes hypertension, jugular venous distention, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, indicating heart failure. Metoprolol and lisinopril are both used for hypertension and heart failure. However, metoprolol is a beta blocker, which can reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, beneficial in heart failure. Atenolol and propranolol are also beta blockers but are less commonly used than metoprolol in this context due to its proven efficacy and safety profile in heart failure patients. Therefore, metoprolol is the best choice for reducing mortality in this patient.

Answer: C",1872
949,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a productive cough, worsening shortness of breath, and diffuse wheezes and crackles, indicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. Prednisone is indicated for acute exacerbations of COPD to reduce inflammation. Albuterol is used for bronchodilation. Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist that can be used in COPD but is not typically the first-line treatment for acute exacerbations. Montelukast and theophylline are not as effective for acute exacerbations compared to corticosteroids and bronchodilators. 

Answer: A",1961
950,Mechanism,False,C,A,"Reasoning: The description of the epithelial cells in the thyroid gland as a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei is characteristic of simple cuboidal epithelium. This type of epithelium is not found in the ovaries, vagina, or vulva. The fallopian tubes, however, can be lined by simple cuboidal epithelium in certain regions, particularly near the fimbriae where absorption and transport of eggs occur.

Answer: C",1271
951,Treatment,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient is seeking advice for smoking cessation and has a history of multiple failed attempts, including using nicotine lozenges which caused side effects. She also has bulimia nervosa, which could complicate the use of additional oral medications like varenicline. Diazepam is not indicated for smoking cessation and would not address the behavioral aspect of quitting smoking. Motivational interviewing is a client-centered counseling style that helps explore and resolve ambivalence, making it suitable for addressing the patient's history of unsuccessful attempts and current desire to quit. Therefore, motivational interviewing is the most appropriate next step.

Answer: D",2353
952,Treatment,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient has severe diarrhea and bloating due to celiac disease. Diphenoxylate is indicated for treating diarrhea, and since the patient does not have a Clostridioides difficile infection, it is safe to use. Prednisone is used for inflammation and immune suppression, which is not relevant here. Avoiding dairy and soy products is part of a gluten-free diet but not a temporary solution for diarrhea. Therefore, Diphenoxylate is the most appropriate recommendation.

Answer: B",2230
953,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with signs of heart failure (shortness of breath, orthopnea, jugular vein distention, PMI displacement, S4 gallop, and holosystolic murmur) and lower limb edema, which suggests a prerenal azotemia due to reduced cardiac output. However, his serum creatinine is slightly elevated (1.9 mg/dL), making it difficult to distinguish between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. 

- **Sulfosalicylic acid test**: This test is not commonly used for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic kidney disease.
- **Urine sodium content**: This test can indicate prerenal azotemia if the urine sodium is low (<20 mEq/L).
- **Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)**: This test is more specific for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic kidney disease by measuring urea clearance.
- **Nitrates in urine**: This test is not relevant for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic kidney disease.

The fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) is the most useful test for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic kidney disease.

Answer: C",2412
954,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, malaise, vomiting, nausea, and decreased urination, along with laboratory findings of elevated WBCs and casts in the urine. These findings suggest a urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis. The presence of WBC casts in the urine is indicative of an inflammatory process involving the kidneys. 

- **Janeway lesions** are small, painless, round, non-follicular lesions on the palms and soles, associated with endocarditis. They do not fit the context.
- **Diffuse maculopapular rash** is not specifically mentioned or implied by the clinical presentation.
- **Malar rash** is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but is not indicated by the current symptoms or laboratory findings.
- **Erythema nodosum** is associated with various conditions including infections, medications, and inflammatory processes but does not align with the given symptoms.

Answer: D",2537
955,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient reports that even simple tasks like getting ready in the morning have become burdensome, indicating significant limitations in physical activity. Sitting down alleviates her symptoms, suggesting she experiences symptoms during physical exertion but can still rest. This aligns with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III, which describes patients who experience symptoms during physical activity but are still able to rest without symptoms.

Answer: C",2228
956,Mechanism,False,B,A,"Reasoning: The patient's intermittent stabbing face pain, triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth, is characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia. The decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution and the history of weakness in her right arm suggest a possible demyelinating disease like multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the specific facial pain and triggering factors are more indicative of trigeminal neuralgia. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation. 

Answer: B",2232
957,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, indicating a risk of Rh incompatibility. Anti-D immune globulin (Rh immunoglobulin) is used to prevent Rh sensitization in Rh-negative women who have been exposed to Rh-positive blood. Since the patient has not yet delivered and there is no evidence of fetal-maternal hemorrhage, administration of Anti-D IgG is most appropriate at this time to prevent potential sensitization.

Answer: B",2039
958,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss, indicative of hyperglycemia. The HbA1c is elevated at 9%, confirming diabetes. The urinalysis shows glucosuria (glucose 199 mg/dl) and occasional yeast, suggesting poor glycemic control and potential urinary tract infection. The other options do not align with the clinical presentation and lab findings. Disruption of primary active transport or passive transport would not explain the presence of yeast in the urine. Increased glomerular filtration rate is not typically associated with glucosuria without proteinuria. Secondary active transporters failing to completely reabsorb glucose is consistent with the high glucose levels in the urine.

Answer: B",2722
959,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with stiffness in the arm, difficulty combing hair, and reaching objects high on the shelf. These symptoms suggest limited shoulder mobility and reduced range of motion, which aligns with subacromial bursitis. Subacromial bursitis often causes shoulder pain and stiffness, particularly with overhead activities. The patient's sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity support this diagnosis. Other conditions like rotator cuff impingement, adhesive capsulitis, and glenohumeral osteoarthritis can cause shoulder pain and stiffness, but they typically present with more specific symptoms such as localized tenderness, severe pain with movement, and chronic joint pain respectively. Given the context and symptoms, subacromial bursitis is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D",2196
960,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a high hemoglobin level (20 g/dL) and hematocrit (60%), indicating polycythemia. This is consistent with a myeloproliferative neoplasm, which can cause excessive production of red blood cells. The patient's symptoms of headache and dizziness could be related to increased blood viscosity and hyperviscosity syndrome. No evidence suggests medication side effects, neuronal hyperexcitability, or toxic exposure. 

Answer: B",3079
961,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of severe mania and is currently on lithium, which is a common treatment for bipolar disorder. Given her history of acute episodes and the need for emergency department visits, it is crucial to maintain stable lithium levels to prevent recurrence of mania during pregnancy. Folic acid supplementation alone is not sufficient to manage the risk of lithium exposure. Polytherapy and switching to valproate are not necessary unless there is evidence of lithium toxicity or specific contraindications to lithium. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is to continue lithium at a stable dose under close monitoring.

Answer: A",1841
962,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, fever, and purulent discharge, indicative of a pelvic infection. The presence of a tender adnexal mass suggests an abscess, which requires prompt treatment. Ciprofloxacin, previously used, may not be effective against all potential pathogens. Given the severity of symptoms and the need for broad-spectrum coverage, intravenous antibiotics are necessary. Ceftriaxone and doxycycline cover a wide range of STIs and anaerobic bacteria commonly involved in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and abscesses. Inpatient admission ensures close monitoring and appropriate management.

Answer: A",2833
963,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The end-systolic volume (ESV) is given as 80 mL. To find the ejection fraction (EF), we use the formula: EF = (SV - ESV) / SV * 100, where SV is the stroke volume. Since the systemic vascular resistance is low (90/60 mm Hg), it suggests reduced afterload, which typically results in higher stroke volume. Given the ESV of 80 mL, if we assume a typical SV around 100-120 mL, the EF would be approximately 20-25%. The closest option is 25%.

Answer: C",1768
964,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with suppurative, erythematous, and bulging tympanic membrane, indicating acute otitis media (AOM). The immobility of the tympanic membrane and hearing loss suggest involvement of the middle ear. Given the symptoms and the need for effective coverage against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, cefotaxime is the most appropriate choice due to its broad spectrum of activity. Amoxicillin and cephalexin are less suitable as they primarily cover gram-positive bacteria, and cefepime is broader but not specifically indicated for this condition.

Answer: B",2385
965,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of acute, sharp pain, warmth, swelling, and erythema in the MTP joint are consistent with gout. Gout is caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals, which can be treated with colchicine. However, colchicine can cause bone marrow suppression leading to pancytopenia. None of the other drugs listed (antibody to soluble factor, inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, or inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption) are known to cause pancytopenia. Inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, like allopurinol, are used to prevent gout but do not cause pancytopenia.

Answer: D",1656
966,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction and is now experiencing similar symptoms. Given the context of a recent myocardial infarction, troponin levels are the most specific marker for myocardial injury. While lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can indicate cellular damage, it is less specific for myocardial injury compared to troponin. Alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase (CK-MB) are not as specific or sensitive for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Therefore, an elevated troponin level would have the most diagnostic utility.

Answer: D",2031
967,Treatment,False,C,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a swollen and tender left wrist with limited range of motion and decreased grip strength. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation, and Finkelstein's test is negative, which suggests a possible ganglion cyst or tenosynovitis rather than a fracture. X-rays show no abnormalities, ruling out a fracture. Corticosteroid injections are not typically the first-line treatment for suspected ganglion cysts. Percutaneous pinning is too aggressive for a non-specific wrist swelling without clear fracture. Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks is a reasonable conservative approach.

Answer: C",2261
968,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and positive pANCA, which suggests an autoimmune etiology. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showing focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation is characteristic of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and is known to cause periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis. The other options are less specific to PSC and more indicative of other conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis (选项B) or cholangiocarcinoma (选项C, D).

Answer: A",2211
969,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with a painful, tender, and purulent ulcer on the labia majora, along with unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. These symptoms are characteristic of chancroid, which is caused by *Haemophilus ducreyi*. The ulcer is painful and purulent, unlike the painless ulcers seen in syphilis (caused by *Treponema pallidum*). Herpes simplex virus type 2 typically presents with painful blisters rather than a purulent ulcer. *Klebsiella granulomatis* causes granuloma inguinale, which presents with painless, flesh-colored nodules that bleed easily and form granulomas.

Answer: C",2019
970,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient describes persistent feelings of nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety, along with physical symptoms like a racing heart, dizziness, and blackouts. These symptoms are indicative of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Buspirone is effective for treating GAD without producing significant sedation, dependence, or withdrawal effects, making it a suitable choice. Diazepam and alprazolam are benzodiazepines that can cause sedation and dependence, which might not be ideal given the patient's history of substance abuse. Ramelteon is used for insomnia and would not address the patient's anxiety symptoms.

Answer: C",1818
971,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dizziness, lethargy, and decreased serum cortisol and ACTH levels, indicating adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). Addison's disease often leads to hyponatremia due to aldosterone deficiency, which results in sodium loss and water retention. Hyperkalemia is less likely given the normal anion gap and the absence of specific symptoms like palpitations or muscle weakness. Hyperglycemia is unlikely given the absence of significant stressors and the normal glucose levels. Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is not supported by the clinical presentation.
Answer: D",2328
972,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is at 40 weeks of gestation with 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation, indicating full cervical dilation and readiness for delivery. There are no signs of fetal distress or complications that would necessitate amnioinfusion or repositioning. Given her uncomplicated pregnancy and normal vital signs, the most appropriate initial step is to provide reassurance to the patient and prepare for vaginal delivery.

Answer: C",1860
973,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, light-headedness, palpitations, and tongue soreness, which are consistent with pernicious anemia. The presence of a low hematocrit (29%) and large oval-shaped red blood cells on peripheral blood smear further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient has decreased position and vibratory sensation in her lower extremities, indicating neurological involvement, which is common in severe cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. The presence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis does not directly relate to the symptoms of pernicious anemia. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are specific to pernicious anemia, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Atrophy of G cells and antithrombotic state are not directly related to the presented symptoms. Decreased methylmalonic acid levels would indicate adequate vitamin B12 status, which is not the case here.

Answer: B",1745
974,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has recently relapsed into smoking after a year of abstinence. Additionally, he presents with shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, which are progressive symptoms. These symptoms along with the recent return to smoking suggest that the patient is in the process of reverting back to his old habits, indicating a relapse rather than being in maintenance or contemplation stages.

Answer: D",2490
975,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The man is accusing his wife of behaviors (flirting with the waiter) that he himself is exhibiting. This suggests that he is projecting his own feelings and behaviors onto his wife, attributing his own desires and actions to her. This is a classic example of projection, where the individual unconsciously attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to another person.

Answer: C",1516
976,Treatment,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient is seeking an elective abortion and is in the early stages of pregnancy. Given that she is only 4 weeks pregnant, the most appropriate procedure would be one that can be performed safely in the outpatient setting without the need for labor induction. Manual uterine aspiration and oxytocin-induced labor are typically used later in pregnancy. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is more commonly used in later stages of pregnancy. Mifepristone plus misoprostol is a safe and effective method for terminating a pregnancy in the first trimester, up to 9 weeks gestation.

Answer: D",2168
977,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient describes brown, greasy appearing lesions on his forehead that he cannot peel off. Melanoma typically presents as a dark mole or spot that changes in size, color, or texture, and is not described here. Acanthosis nigricans involves velvety, hyperpigmented lesions, often in body folds, which does not match the forehead location. Erythema nodosum causes painful, red or blue lumps on the shins and thighs, not forehead lesions. Seborrheic keratosis fits the description of brown, greasy appearing lesions that are benign and non-itchy.

Answer: B",1733
978,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's history of chronic smoking and alcohol use, along with decreased breath sounds, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, leading to decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and increased residual volume as the lungs become hyperinflated to maintain adequate ventilation. Therefore, the most likely findings are decreased FEV1 and increased residual volume.

Answer: C",1750
979,Mechanism,False,D,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea, fatigue, and a heavy feeling in the chest, along with a right-sided pleural effusion. The pleural fluid analysis shows a high pleural fluid to serum protein ratio (7.0) and elevated LDH (258 U/L), suggesting transudative fluid rather than exudative. 

- **Congestive heart failure (A)**: Typically presents with a transudative effusion, but the high protein ratio suggests an exudative process, not consistent here.
- **Liver cirrhosis (B)**: Not directly related to pleural effusion formation and does not explain the high protein ratio.
- **Lymphoma (C)**: Can cause pleural effusions, but the high protein ratio and elevated LDH suggest a different etiology.
- **Nephrotic syndrome (D)**: Characterized by high proteinuria leading to hypoalbuminemia, resulting in a high pleural fluid to serum protein ratio, which fits the findings.

Answer: D",1864
980,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent pregnancy loss in the second trimester, which is concerning for antiphospholipid syndrome or other autoimmune conditions like SLE. Given the context of lupus and the patient's history, testing for antiphospholipid antibodies would be appropriate. However, none of the given options directly test for these antibodies. 

Karotyping can identify chromosomal abnormalities, but it is not specific for recurrent pregnancy loss. A hysterosalpingogram assesses the anatomy of the fallopian tubes and uterus, which does not address autoimmune causes. Prolactin levels are not relevant to autoimmune conditions or recurrent pregnancy loss. TSH levels are important for thyroid function but not specifically related to recurrent pregnancy loss in this context.

Answer: D",2044
981,Mechanism,True,C,C,"Reasoning: Fexofenadine is an antihistamine that works by blocking histamine receptors, which helps relieve allergy symptoms. It is known to have fewer sedative side effects compared to diphenhydramine. This reduced sedation is due to its relative lipophobicity, meaning it is less lipid-soluble and thus crosses the blood-brain barrier less easily, reducing central nervous system effects.

Answer: C",2576
982,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's history of working in a naval shipyard and the diagnosis of mesothelioma suggest long-term exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma is strongly associated with asbestos exposure and typically presents with pleural involvement. Given the diffuse thickening of the pleura noted on CT, a pleural effusion is a common complication of mesothelioma. 

Pneumothorax is not directly related to mesothelioma and would not be expected based on the given information. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) could occur due to various insults, but it is not specifically linked to mesothelioma. Bronchioalveolar carcinoma is a type of lung cancer, unrelated to mesothelioma.

Answer: B",2275
983,Treatment,False,A,C,"Reasoning: The patient has small esophageal varices with red spots, indicating a high risk of bleeding. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is a common procedure to treat such varices and prevent bleeding. Metoprolol and Nadolol are beta blockers, but they are not typically used as first-line therapy for preventing variceal bleeding. Repeating the endoscopy would not prevent bleeding and is not indicated in this scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is endoscopic sclerotherapy.

Answer: A",1602
984,Treatment,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include excessive salivation, tearing, and confusion, which are consistent with muscarinic effects. These symptoms are characteristic of organophosphate poisoning, where acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like physostigmine would exacerbate the symptoms. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and would worsen the condition. 2-Pralidoxime is used for reactivating acetylcholinesterase after organophosphate exposure but is not indicated without confirmation of such exposure. Intubation is a supportive measure and not the initial step in suspected organophosphate poisoning. Therefore, the best initial step is to administer physostigmine to counteract the effects.

Answer: B",2080
985,Diagnosis,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient's history of occasional knee pain, reduced range of motion, and crepitus in both knees, along with the elevated leukocyte count and absolute lymphocyte count, suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm³ is significantly elevated, which is more consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) than monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple myeloma (MM) typically presents with bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and renal impairment, none of which are present in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Answer: A",2378
986,Diagnosis,False,B,C,"Reasoning: The patient has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. This suggests a mobile mass, which is more consistent with neoplastic transformation rather than asbestos inhalation, abscess formation, or opportunistic colonization. Asbestos inhalation typically presents as fibrotic changes or pleural plaques, not a mobile mass. Abscesses usually present with more localized symptoms and do not shift upon repositioning. Opportunistic colonization would not explain the shifting mass. Therefore, the most likely cause is neoplastic transformation.

Answer: B",1908
987,Prevention,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include jerking movements, which could be indicative of seizures. Given the context, the musty odor and poor eye contact suggest a metabolic disorder, specifically phenylketonuria (PKU), where there is a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase leading to elevated levels of phenylalanine. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine would have most likely prevented these symptoms by reducing the toxic levels of phenylalanine in the brain.

Answer: B",2625
988,Diagnosis,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The p-value of 0.049 indicates that the null hypothesis was rejected, suggesting a statistically significant association between low birth weight and obesity. However, the confidence interval at 95% does not affect the p-value interpretation directly. Type 1 error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis, which seems to be avoided here since the null hypothesis was rejected based on the p-value. Type 2 error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, but there's no indication of failing to detect an effect here. Therefore, the correct statement is that a type 1 error has not been made.

Answer: D",1610
989,Diagnosis,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with watery diarrhea, constant thirst, and decreased energy levels. These symptoms are consistent with a condition where there is an increased loss of electrolytes, particularly potassium, through the gastrointestinal tract due to an enterotoxin. The enterotoxin from bacteria can cause increased intestinal permeability leading to electrolyte loss. The other options are less likely: impaired iron absorption would not typically cause diarrhea; increased serotonin production from fluoxetine is unlikely to cause such severe electrolyte imbalance; and an invasive bacterial infection would more likely present with fever, leukocytosis, and other systemic signs.

Answer: A",2358
990,Diagnosis,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting, and an explosive release of stool during a rectal exam. These symptoms suggest a possible congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung disease). Anorectal manometry can assess the function of the anal and rectal muscles and is useful in diagnosing Hirschsprung disease by measuring the absence of electrical activity in the affected segment of the colon. An abdominal CT scan or ultrasonography would not directly assess the neuromuscular function of the colon. Rectal suction biopsy is invasive and not typically the first-line diagnostic tool for this condition.

Answer: C",2921
991,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include progressive left leg pain, marked tenderness along the mid-femur, and multiple lytic lesions with new bone formation. The presence of small round blue cells in the biopsy is highly suggestive of Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcoma typically presents with more aggressive bone destruction and is less likely to present with such a clear pattern of new bone formation. Osteochondroma and osteoid osteoma do not present with the same clinical and radiographic features. Therefore, Ewing sarcoma is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C",1451
992,Mechanism,False,B,D,"Reasoning: Suppression is a defense mechanism where a person unconsciously blocks out unpleasant or anxiety-inducing thoughts or feelings. Option B indicates that the patient is expressing extreme gratitude and believes they have been cured, which suggests an unconscious denial of their condition. This aligns with the concept of suppression.

Answer: B",1600
993,Treatment,True,A,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with severe chest pain, hypotension, and ST-elevations, indicating a myocardial infarction. The addition of hemoptysis would be a new, concerning development, potentially indicating cardiac tamponade or pulmonary complications. Easy fatigability and persistent ST-segment elevation are less immediately life-threatening compared to hemoptysis. Shortness of breath is already present and does not indicate a new, more concerning development.

Answer: A",2228
994,Mechanism,False,D,B,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms include chronic progressive dyspnea, increased work of breathing, and a history of exacerbations, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The medication chosen has mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties, which aligns with medications like N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC works by reducing airway surface tension and improving mucus clearance through its mucoactive effects and antioxidant properties. None of the other options (DNA hydrolysis, disulfide bond cleavage, or endothelin-1 antagonism) directly match these properties.

Answer: D",2148
995,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient is at term gestation with no complications and a history of previous uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at term. There is no indication of polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid), acute respiratory distress, or placental abruption. The most relevant concern is the risk of meconium aspiration, given the term gestation and potential for meconium-stained amniotic fluid due to fetal stress or other factors.

Answer: C",1734
996,Diagnosis,False,A,C,"Reasoning: IgG is the most common type of antibody and represents about 75% of serum antibodies. It is not a dimer but a monomer. The only immunoglobulin found as a dimer is IgM, which is primarily involved in protecting against invasive helminth infections. Therefore, the other options related to viral infections, inhibiting bacterial adherence, and providing specific recognition do not match the dimeric form.

Answer: A",1345
997,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with shallow breathing, shallow pulse, and shallow respiratory rate, indicating hypoventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a high PCO2 (70 mm Hg), which is consistent with hypoventilation. Diabetic ketoacidosis typically presents with Kussmaul breathing (deep, labored breathing) and metabolic acidosis (low pH and low bicarbonate). Diuretic overdose would not cause such profound hypoventilation. Opioid overdose can cause respiratory depression but does not typically result in such a high PCO2 level. Hyperventilation would lead to hypocapnia (low PCO2), which is not seen here.

Answer: C",2146
998,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has presented with jaundice and has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The most appropriate initial statement should be direct, clear, and considerate of the patient's emotional state. Option A is inappropriate as it assumes prior knowledge and could be seen as dismissive. Option C is not relevant as it pertains to designating a healthcare proxy, which is not the immediate concern. Option B is the most appropriate as it directly addresses the seriousness of the situation while being respectful and considerate of the patient's emotional state. 

Answer: B",2263
999,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of mild vision impairment and night driving difficulties suggest ocular issues rather than a change in his psychiatric condition. Given that he is on a low-potency typical antipsychotic and has been compliant with his medication, it is unlikely that a simple adjustment in medication dosage would be necessary. Ocular examination under anesthesia is not typically the first step unless there is a specific indication for sedation. A slit-lamp examination is a non-invasive, standard procedure that can help identify any ocular abnormalities without the need for additional interventions.

Answer: D",1268
