0,Treatment,False,A,B,"Reasoning: The resident should disclose the error to the patient and include it in the operative report. This ensures transparency and proper documentation, which is crucial for patient care and medical record integrity. Reporting the injury to the patient and including it in the report is the standard practice in medical ethics and legal requirements.

Answer: A"
1,Mechanism,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient experienced sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) after chemotherapy, suggesting ototoxicity from the chemotherapeutic agent. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy often uses drugs like cisplatin, which are known to cause ototoxicity by damaging cochlear hair cells. Cisplatin works by generating free radicals, which can lead to oxidative stress and hair cell damage.

Answer: C"
2,Diagnosis,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with decreased urinary output, malaise, and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, suggesting a possible vascular issue. The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, which are characteristic of cholesterol embolization. This condition often occurs after invasive procedures like cardiac catheterization, fitting the patient's recent history. 

Elimination: 
- Renal papillary necrosis does not typically present with vascular emboli.
- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis involves eosinophilia and vasculitis, not specifically vascular emboli.
- Polyarteritis nodosa affects medium-sized arteries but does not typically present with intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.

Answer: B"
3,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: The patient presents with fever, hypotension, and signs of sepsis, suggesting a severe infection. The blood culture is most likely to show a pathogen capable of causing septicemia and septic shock. The presence of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with fatty acids suggests a Gram-negative organism. E. coli is known to cause sepsis and can form pink colonies on MacConkey agar due to lactose fermentation.

Answer: D"
4,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient presents with itchy, watery eyes, bilateral conjunctival injection, and watery discharge, along with a history of similar episodes in spring and a family history suggestive of allergies. These symptoms are consistent with allergic conjunctivitis. Erythromycin ointment (A) is used for bacterial infections, not allergies. Warm compresses (C) are used for conditions like styes or blepharitis, not allergic conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone eye drops (D) are corticosteroids, which are reserved for severe cases and should be monitored by an optometrist. Ketotifen eye drops (B) are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, commonly used for allergic conjunctivitis.

Answer: B"
5,Treatment,False,C,D,"Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the epigastric area, diaphoresis, and marked distress are consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given the patient's history of untreated hypertension and recent cocaine abuse, ACS is highly suspected. Immediate treatment should focus on stabilizing the patient and preventing further ischemia. Propranolol and labetalol are beta-blockers and alpha-beta blockers, respectively, which are appropriate for ACS. However, diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and not typically the first-line agent in ACS unless there is a specific indication like a refractory angina. Reassurance alone is insufficient without addressing the underlying condition.

Answer: C"
6,Diagnosis,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with right flank pain, abdominal tenderness, and right flank tenderness, along with dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis on ultrasound. These findings suggest a blockage in the urinary tract. Renal artery stenosis and common iliac artery aneurysm are less likely to cause ureteral dilation. Benign prostatic hyperplasia primarily affects males and would more commonly present with lower urinary tract symptoms rather than flank pain. Urethral stricture is less likely given the location of symptoms and imaging findings.

Answer: C"
7,Treatment,True,C,C,"Reasoning: The patient presents with acute chest pain, ST-segment depressions, and elevated troponin, indicating acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, which is typically performed in conjunction with dual antiplatelet therapy. Aspirin is already being used, so we need to add a second antiplatelet agent. Clopidogrel is the standard choice for dual antiplatelet therapy post-coronary intervention.

Answer: C"
8,Treatment,True,B,B,"Reasoning: The patient has no symptoms or physical findings that would indicate a contraindication. Option A (history of stroke or venous thromboembolism) and Option C (breast cancer) do not inherently contraindicate copper IUD placement. However, active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can increase the risk of complications such as perforation or infection during insertion. Liver neoplasms can affect hormone metabolism, but copper IUDs do not rely on hormones.

Answer: B"
9,Diagnosis,False,Unknown,A,"Reasoning: The patient presents with concerns about nail appearance, which suggests onychomycosis. The context describes typical symptoms such as white or yellow nail discoloration and thickening. None of the other options (silvery plaques, flesh-colored papules, erosions of dental enamel, or a heart murmur) are related to nail conditions or onychomycosis.

Answer: None of the provided options (A, B, C, D) are directly related to onychomycosis. However, if forced to choose the least unrelated, option B (flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region) is the closest, but still not relevant.
