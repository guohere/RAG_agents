1. **Analyze the Patient's Symptoms/History**: The patient is an 83-year-old man who was admitted with urosepsis and is now showing signs of irritability, hallucinations (talking to someone when no one is present), agitation, and restlessness. These symptoms suggest delirium, which is a common complication in hospitalized elderly patients, especially those with underlying infections like urosepsis.

173,Diagnosis,False,Unknown,A,"Reasoning: 
1. **Analyze the Patient's Symptoms/History**: The patient presents with fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches over the past 2 months. These symptoms could suggest an underlying condition affecting cortisol levels. Additionally, there is no personal or family history of serious illness, and she is not on any medications except a multivitamin. The metyrapone stimulation test ruled out adrenal insufficiency, which means the issue is likely related to cortisol production or sensitivity..."
174,Diagnosis,True,D,D,"Reasoning: 
1. **Analyze the Patient's Symptoms/History**: The study compares two groups of patients with GBM: those diagnosed through asymptomatic screening and those diagnosed after developing symptoms. The key finding is that the asymptomatic group had a longer survival time by 6 weeks compared to the symptomatic group. This suggests that the earlier detection through screening may not necessarily lead to a longer actual survival time but rather a longer apparent survival time due to the timi..."

176,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: 
1. **Analyze the patient's symptoms/history**: The problem provides information about a PET radiotracer used to evaluate patients with Parkinson’s disease. We need to calculate the specificity of the test, which is defined as the proportion of true negatives among those who tested negative. In other words, it is the number of patients without the disease who tested negative divided by the total number of patients without the disease.

1. **Analyze the Patient's Symptoms/History**:
   - The patient presents with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours, which improves when the testicle is lifted. This suggests involvement of the testicle itself rather than a mass or varicocele.
   - He also reports a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days, indicating possible urethritis.
   - There is no urethral discharge, which rules out gonorrhea, which typically presents..."

192,Mechanism,True,D,D,"Reasoning: 
1. **Analyze the Patient's Symptoms/History**: The study stratifies the results based on CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. It shows that cART adherence significantly predicts DLBCL risk in patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm³ but not in those with counts above 200/mm³. This indicates a different relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk depending on the CD4+ cell count category.
